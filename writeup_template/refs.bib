  abstract = { A detailed calculation of the coagulation kinetics of a soot aerosol has been performed by simulating numerically the coagulation kinetics with the inclusion of van der Waals forces. The van der Waals forces between two soot particles at 1600 K and 1 atmosphere give rise 10 a collision rate enhancement which varies between a maximum of about 2.4 for 1 nm diameter particles to just over 1 for particles of dissimilar sizes. The total coagulation rate with the estimated enhancement factors was about twice the unenhanced rates; this compares favorably with experiment. Over the duration of the computation the soot aerosol size distribution approaches closely the self-preserving form, whether or not the collisional enhancement factors are included. },

  abstract = { A two-dimensional simulation of a non-premixed ethylene–air flame was conducted by employing a detailed gas-phase reaction mechanism considering polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, an aerosol-dynamics-based soot model using a method of moments with interpolative closure, and a grey gas and soot radiation model using the discrete transfer method. Interaction of the sooting flame with a prescribed decaying random velocity field was investigated, with a primary interest in the effects of velocity fluctuations on the flame structure and the associated soot formation process for a fuel-strip configuration and a composition with mature soot growth. The temporally evolving simulation revealed a multi-layered soot formation process within the flame, at a level of detail not properly described by previous studies based on simplified soot models utilizing acetylene or naphthalene precursors for initial soot inception. The overall effect of the flame topology on the soot formation was found to be consistent with previous experimental studies, while a unique behaviour of localised strong oxidation was also noted. The imposed velocity fluctuations led to an increase of the scalar dissipation rate in the sooting zone, causing a net suppression in the soot production rate. Considering the complex structure of the soot formation layer, the effects of the imposed fluctuations vary depending on the individual soot reactions. For the conditions under study, the soot oxidation reaction was identified as the most sensitive to the fluctuations and was mainly responsible for the local suppression of the net soot production. },

  abstract  = { A weighted sum of gray gases model (WSGGM)-based low-resolution spectral model for calculating radiation transfer in combustion gases is applied to estimate self-absorption of radiation energy in one-dimensional opposed-flow flames. Development of such a model is necessary in order to enable detailed chemistry-radiation interaction calculations including self-absorption. A database of band model parameters which can be applied to various one-dimensional opposed-flow diffusion and partially premixed flames is created. This in-situ flame property-based database is necessary for the application of the WSGGM to real flames, since previously developed databases were only for homogeneous and isothermal radiation paths. For the validation of the model and database, low-resolution spectral intensities leaving the flat flame in a direction normal to the fuel exit plane are calculated and compared with the results of a narrow-band model based on the Curtis-Godson approximation. Good agreement has been found between them. The resulting radiation model is coupled to the OPPDIF code to calculate the self-absorption of radiant energy and compared with the results of an optically thin calculation and the results of a discrete ordinates calculation in conjunction with the statistical narrow-band model. Significant self-absorption of radiation is found for the flames considered here, particularly on the fuel side of the reaction zone. However, the self-absorption does not have significant effects on the flame structure in this case. Even in the cases of low-velocity diffusion flame and a partially premixed flame having a low equivalence ratio, the effects of self-absorption of radiation on the flame temperature and the production of minor species are not significant. },

  abstract = { Abstract A new model is presented to construct a realistic form for the joint-scalar probability density function, as opposed to assuming its shape, with application to the moment equation solution of turbulent (non-premixed) combustion. The model approximates the thermo-chemical pdf in a general turbulent reacting flow by the scalar pdf that decayed from an initial binary field in homogeneous turbulence, parameterized by an appropriate set of lower moments. Full resolution, complex chemistry, scalar decay simulations are achieved with the computationally affordable Linear Eddy Model. The constructed pdf, in contrast to the assumed shape approach, incorporates the underlying physics of advection by all turbulent scales, molecular diffusion and chemical reaction. The constructed pdf has no adjustable constants or calibration factors, and its tabulation allows the expensive turbulence-chemistry interactions to be decoupled from the moment equation solution. In an a-priori experimental comparison using a two variable chemical mechanism, the constructed pdf shows qualitative superiority over a common assumed shape pdf. In application to the steady-state solution of a turbulent, hydrogen, round jet flame, the model demonstrates comparative agreement with the conventional assumed shape pdf, and predicts improved OH concentration fluctuation intensity. },

This review focuses on six substantial lines of research that have been pursued since 1997 that have helped elucidate our understanding about the effects of PM on human health. There has been substantial progress in the evaluation of PM health effects at different time-scales of exposure and in the exploration of the shape of the concentration-response function. There has also been emerging evidence of PM-related cardiovascular health effects and growing knowledge regarding interconnected general pathophysiological pathways that link PM exposure with cardiopulmonary morbidity and mortality. Despite important gaps in scientific knowledge and continued reasons for some skepticism, a comprehensive evaluation of the research findings provides persuasive evidence that exposure to fine particulate air pollution has adverse effects on cardiopulmonary health. Although much of this research has been motivated by environmental public health policy, these results have important scientific, medical, and public health implications that are broader than debates over legally mandated air quality standards. },

  abstract = { Abstract Over the past several years, numerous studies have linked ambient concentrations of particulate matter (PM) to adverse health effects, and more recent studies have identified PM size and surface area as important factors in determining the health effects of PM. This study contributes to a better understanding of the evolution of particle size distributions in exhaust plumes with unconfined dilution by ambient air. It combines computational fluid dynamics (CFD) with an aerosol dynamics model to examine the effects of different streamlines in an exhaust plume, ambient particle size distributions, and vehicle and wind speed on the particle size distribution in an exhaust plume. CFD was used to calculate the flow field and gas mixing for unconfined dilution of a vehicle exhaust plume, and the calculated dilution ratios were then used as input to the aerosol dynamics simulation. The results of the study show that vehicle speed affected the particle size distribution of an exhaust plume because increasing vehicle speed caused more rapid dilution and inhibited coagulation. Ambient particle size distributions had an effect on the smaller sized particles (∼10 nm range under some conditions) and larger sized particles (>2 μm) of the particle size distribution. The ambient air particle size distribution affects the larger sizes of the exhaust plume because vehicle exhaust typically contains few particles larger than 2 μm. Finally, the location of a streamline in the exhaust plume had little effect on the particle size distribution; the particle size distribution along any streamline at a distance x differed by less than 5\% from the particle size distributions along any other streamline at distance x. },

First, the Probabilistic Eulerian Lagrangian turbulent combustion model, which is theoretically able to describe chemical reactions occurring in a turbulent flow for a wide range of Damkohler numbers, is presented and justified. Then, the chemistry model which accounts for soot formation and oxidation is exposed and validated in rich ethylene premixed laminar flames. This modelling approach coupling turbulence and chemistry is eventually applied to predict soot levels in a turbulent jet diffusion flame of ethylene burning in still air. Results are in good agreement with experimental data and the peak value of soot volume fraction on the centreline is fairly well described even though an accurate radiative heat transfer model is still necessary to be more predictive on mean temperature levels. },

Soot particles from the exhaust of a running diesel engine were oxidized in the post-flame gases from a premixed burner. Measurements made at different heights above the flame included the particle size distribution and velocity, the gas temperature and the oxygen concentration. The results showed that the measured oxidation rates were between the values predicted by the Nagle-Strickland-Constable formula and those predicted by the Lee formula. The experimental results from the present study were combined with those of other experimenters and used to modify the Nagle-Strickland-Constable and Lee formulae in an effort to improve their predictive capability. },

The first method cannot account for the preheating effect, while the second one can. A detailed gas-phase reaction mechanism and complex thermal and transport properties are used. The fully coupled elliptic equations are solved. A simple two-equation soot model is used to model the soot process coupled with detailed gas-phase chemistry. The numerical results are compared with experimental data and indicate that the flame preheating effect has a significant influence on the prediction of soot yields. Both methods give reasonable flame temperature and soot volume fraction distributions. However, quantitatively the second method results in improved flame temperatures and soot volume fractions, especially in the region near the fuel inlet, although the maximum flame temperatures from both methods are slightly lower than that from the experiment. },

The resolution achieved in all three spatial dimensions and in time reaches down to the local strain‐limited molecular diffusion scale in the flow, allowing all three components of the instantaneous scalar gradient vector field ∇ζ(x,t) and their time evolution at every point in the data space to be directly evaluated. Results are presented in the form of fine structure maps of the instantaneous dissipation field loge ∇ζ⋅∇ζ(x,t) in several spatially adjacent data planes within an individual three‐dimensional spatial data volume, as well as in several temporally successive data planes from a sequence of such three‐dimensional data volumes. The degree of anisotopy in the underlying scalar gradient field is characterized in terms of the joint distribution β(ϑ,φ) of spherical orientation angles. The probability density of true scalar energy dissipation rates is presented and compared with the distributions that would result from lower‐dimensional measurements of the scalar gradient vector. From this the ‘‘spottiness’’ of the scalar dissipation field is directly quantified by determining the true fraction of the total dissipation that occurs in any given volume fraction of the flow. },

Both a priori and a posteriori assessments are conducted. The SGS turbulence model used is the dynamic Smagorinsky model (DSM). Two classes of SGS combustion models are employed in this study. These include the conserved scalar approach and the direct closure approach. Specifically, the SGS combustion models involve several forms of direct filtered reaction rate closures, including a scale similarity filtered reaction rate model (SSFRRM), and a mixing controlled strained laminar flamelet model (SLFM) in the form of thermochemical state relationships, obtained from the DNS, and two assumed forms for the subgrid mixture fraction filtered density function (FDF). In general, LES results are in reasonable agreement with DNS results and highlight the performance of the various SGS combustion models. In particular, in the context of the present study, it is found that: (1) the SLFM cases overpredict product formation due to their inability to capture finite-rate chemistry effects; (2) due to the relatively low values of the SGS mixture fraction variance in the flow under study, the SLFM results are not sensitive to the form of the assumed FDF; and (3) in comparison to the other models investigated, the SSFRRM combustion model provides the best agreement with the DNS for product formation. },

  abstract = { The direct quadrature method of moments (DQMOM) can be employed to close population balance equations (PBEs) governing a wide class of multivariate number density functions (NDFs). Such equations occur over a vast range of scientific applications, including aerosol science, kinetic theory, multiphase flows, turbulence modeling, and control theory, to name just a few. As the name implies, DQMOM uses quadrature weights and abscissas to approximate the moments of the NDF, and the number of quadrature nodes determines the accuracy of the closure. For nondegenerate univariate cases (i.e., a sufficiently smooth NDF), the N weights and N abscissas are uniquely determined by the first 2N non-negative integer moments of the NDF. Moreover, an efficient product−difference algorithm exists to compute the weights and abscissas from the moments. In contrast, for a d-dimensional NDF, a total of (1 + d)N multivariate moments are required to determine the weights and abscissas, and poor choices for the moment set can lead to nonunique abscissas and even negative weights. In this work, it is demonstrated that optimal moment sets exist for multivariate DQMOM when N = nd quadrature nodes are employed to represent a d-dimensional NDF with n = 1−3 and d = 1−3. Moreover, this choice is independent of the source terms in the PBE governing the time evolution of the NDF. A multivariate Fokker−Planck equation is used to illustrate the numerical properties of the method for d = 3 with n = 2 and 3. },

For lower lead feed rates, the number and volume concentrations increased as the Cl/Pb ratio increased; for higher feed rates, they reached a maximum at intermediate Cl/Pb ratios, then decreased upon a further increase of Cl/Pb ratios.

  abstract        = {A complete understanding of soot particle formation is critical for accurate combustion models. Limited details are known about the molecules and physical processes involved in the formation of nascent soot. The objective of this study was to discover molecular size distribution and particle morphology from freshly nucleated particles. To accomplish this, particles created in a homogeneous, high temperature (1600-2000. K) and pressure (10 atm) environment were collected at well-resolved times throughout the early stages of soot formation and were imaged with a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HRTEM). Image post processing revealed that the molecules deposited on both nascent and aged soot particles had a constant size distribution, and that the molecules were likely to be polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules. Additionally, the images revealed particle morphology. At low temperatures, PAH molecules coagulated to form fairly amorphous particle cores. At high temperatures the particle cores became comprised of agglomerated 2-8 nm diameter particles. Eventually all particle cores became surrounded by layers of molecules while the small particles no longer attached as growth species. The imaged transition from small particle agglomeration at the particle core to surface growth was replicated in a coagulation model. The model quantified the increase in small particle agglomeration that was attributed to an increase in the coagulating molecule's rate of production. © 2011 The Combustion Institute.},

  abstract = {A comprehensive assessment of gas-phase reaction mechanisms and soot models has been performed for atmospheric-pressure laminar ethylene–air flames. Soot modeling is based on a method of moments with interpolative closure. Computed soot volume fractions are compared with experimental measurements for eight flames: four premixed flames from two different burners, and four opposed-flow diffusion flames from two different burners. Seven gas-phase reaction mechanisms have been explored with variations in four key soot model parameters: PAH-based versus acetylene-based nucleation; PAH condensation included versus excluded; surface reactivity steric factor specification; and surface radicals depleted versus conserved. Computed soot volume fractions are most sensitive to variations in the surface reactivity factor and to whether the surface radicals are depleted or conserved. The motivation for this study has been to determine which models should be used for simulations of luminous turbulent flames; there computational efficiency is of paramount importance. A reduced 33-species mechanism together with acetylene-based nucleation, surface reactivity factor variation proposed by [J. Appel, H. Bockhorn, M. Frenklach, Combust. Flame 121 (2000) 122–136], and conserved surface radicals yields acceptable soot volume fractions over a broad range of conditions with an order of magnitude reduction in computational cost compared to a larger 100-species gas-phase reaction mechanism.},

  abstract = {A comprehensive model for luminous turbulent flames is presented. The model features detailed chemistry, radiation and soot models and state-of-the-art closures for turbulence–chemistry interactions and turbulence–radiation interactions. A transported probability density function (PDF) method is used to capture the effects of turbulent fluctuations in composition and temperature. The \{PDF\} method is extended to include soot formation. Spectral gas and soot radiation is modeled using a (particle-based) photon Monte Carlo method coupled with the \{PDF\} method, thereby capturing both emission and absorption turbulence–radiation interactions. An important element of this work is that the gas-phase chemistry and soot models that have been thoroughly validated across a wide range of laminar flames are used in turbulent flame simulations without modification. Six turbulent jet flames are simulated with Reynolds numbers varying from 6700 to 15,000, two fuel types (pure ethylene, 90 % methane– 10 % ethylene blend) and different oxygen concentrations in the oxidizer stream (from 21 % O 2 to 55 % O 2 ). All simulations are carried out with a single set of physical and numerical parameters (model constants). Uniformly good agreement between measured and computed mean temperatures, mean soot volume fractions and (where available) radiative fluxes is found across all flames. This demonstrates that with the combination of a systematic approach and state-of-the-art physical models and numerical algorithms, it is possible to simulate a broad range of luminous turbulent flames with a single model. },

Six turbulent jet flames are simulated with Reynolds numbers varying from 6700 to 15,000, two fuel types (pure ethylene, 90\% methane–10\% ethylene blend) and different oxygen concentrations in the oxidizer stream (from 21\% O2 to 55\% O2). All simulations are carried out with a single set of physical and numerical parameters (model constants). A Lagrangian particle Monte Carlo method is used to solve a modeled joint probability density function (PDF) transport equation, which allows accurate closure for turbulence–chemistry interactions including nonlinear soot subprocesses. Radiation is calculated using a particle-based photon Monte Carlo method that is coupled with the PDF method to accurately account for both emission and absorption turbulence–radiation interactions (TRI). Line-by-line databases are used for accurate spectral radiative properties of CO2 and H2O; soot radiative properties also are modeled as nongray. For the flames that have been investigated, soot emission can be almost 45\% of the total emission, even when the peak soot volume fraction is of the order of a few parts-per-million (ppm) and up to 99\% of soot emission can escape the domain without re-absorption. Turbulence–radiation interactions have a strong effect on the net radiative heat loss from these sooting flames. For a given temperature, species and soot distribution, TRI increases emission from the flames by 30–60\%, and the net heat loss from the flame increases by 45–90\% when accounting for TRI. This is higher than the corresponding increase in radiative heat loss due to TRI in nonsooting flames. Absorption TRI was found to be negligible in these laboratory-scale sooting flames with soot levels on the order of a few ppm, but may be important in larger industrial-scale flames and in higher-pressure systems. },

  abstract = {A comprehensive theoretical development of possible reference approaches in modelling of radiation transfer in non-uniform gaseous media is developed within the framework of the Generalized SLW Model. The notion of absorption spectrum “correlation” adopted currently for global methods in gas radiation is critically revisited and replaced by a less restrictive concept of rank correlated spectrum. Within this framework it is shown that eight different reference approaches are possible, of which only three have been reported in the literature. Among the approaches presented is a novel Rank Correlated SLW Model, which is distinguished by the fact that i) it does not require the specification of a reference gas thermodynamic state, and ii) it preserves the emission term in the spectrally integrated Radiative Transfer Equation. Construction of this reference model requires only two absorption line blackbody distribution functions, and subdivision into gray gases can be performed using standard quadratures. Consequently, this new reference approach appears to have significant advantages over all other methods, and is, in general, a significant improvement in the global modelling of gas radiation. All reference approaches are summarized in the present work, and their use in radiative transfer prediction is demonstrated for simple example cases. Further, a detailed rigorous theoretical development of the improved methods is provided.},

The sensitivity of both the bulk flow and aerosol particle properties to boundary layer effects, even in high Reynolds number flows, is demonstrated for transonic two-phase flow in wet steam de Laval nozzles.

  abstract        = {A computationally efficient bimodal moment model was proposed to describe simultaneous particle formation, coagulation, and surface growth. In the model framework, two discrete modes are introduced to represent a bimodal size distribution: one monodisperse mode accounting for the formation of new particles in the nucleation mode and the other accumulation mode for the growth of the larger particles. The size distribution of the accumulation mode could be approximated by a proper mathematical function. General formulation of the bimodal moment model is first presented, and a bimodal log-normal model (bi-LN model) is described by adopting a log-normal function for the accumulation mode. The prediction results of the proposed bimodal moment model were compared with those of a previous bimodal model and an accurate sectional model. It was demonstrated that the bi-LN model agreed well with the sectional model and correctly described the evolution of bimodal size distribution resulting from the coexistence of particle formation and coagulation. The bi-LN model was also shown to be capable of predicting the growth of particles involving simultaneous particle formation, coagulation and surface growth, which was validated by comparing with the simulation results by the moving sectional model. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {A detailed model is proposed for predicting soot formation from complex solid fuels. The proposed model resolves two particle size distributions, one for soot precursors and another for soot particles. The precursor size distribution is represented with a sectional approach while the soot particle-size distribution is represented with the method of moments and an interpolative closure method is used to resolve fractional methods. Based on established mechanisms, this model includes submodels for precursor coagulation, growth, and con- sumption, as well as soot nucleation, surface growth, agglomeration, and consumption. The model is validated with comparisons to experimental data for two systems: coal combus- tion over a laminar flat-flame burner and biomass gasification. Results are presented for soot yield for three coals at three temperatures each, and for soot yield from three types of biomass at two temperatures each. These results represent a wide range of fuels and varying combustion environments, demonstrating the broad applicability of the model.},

The soot morphology in the post-flame region is studied using computed sintering level distributions, fringe length analysis of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) within the primary soot particles, and TEM-like projections of aggregates. The computed PSDs were sensitive to the minimum particle inception size, the coagulation rate and the inception species concentration. Changes in the particle inception size and the coagulation rate led to an overall shift in the position of the coagulation peak. Only changes in the inception species concentration led to a systematic shift in both the position of the trough between the modes of the bimodal PSD and the coagulation peak at larger diameters. Given the overall model, varying the inception species concentration with each burner-stagnation plate separation was the only means possible to achieve a satisfactory agreement between the experimental and computed PSDs. This study shows that further work is required to better understand the soot precursor chemistry, the inception of soot particles. Additional work may also be needed in the area of experimental mobility sizing for the flame studied here. © 2015 The Combustion Institute.},

The fundamental, advantages and disadvantaged of these methods were reviewed. The Eulerian-Eulerian method is mainly used in the CFD simulation of the two-phase flow in extraction columns to date. The PBM which considers the droplet size distribution and further the concentration distribution is relatively less used in extraction columns.

  abstract = {A Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) of soot formation in an n-heptane/air turbulent nonpremixed flame has been performed to investigate unsteady strain effects on soot growth and transport. For the first time in a DNS of turbulent combustion, Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH) are included via a validated, reduced chemical mechanism. A novel statistical representation of soot aggregates based on the Hybrid Method of Moments is used [M.E. Mueller, G. Blanquart, H. Pitsch, Combust. Flame 156 (2009) 1143–1155], which allows for an accurate state-of-the-art description of soot number density, volume fraction, and morphology of the aggregates. In agreement with previous experimental studies in laminar flames, Damköhler number effects are found to be significant for PAH. Soot nucleation and growth from PAH are locally inhibited by high scalar dissipation rate, thus providing a possible explanation for the experimentally observed reduction of soot yields at increasing levels of mixing in turbulent sooting flames. Furthermore, our data indicate that soot growth models that rely on smaller hydrocarbon species such as acetylene as a proxy for large PAH molecules ignore or misrepresent the effects of turbulent mixing and hydrodynamic strain on soot formation due to differences in the species Damköhler number. Upon formation on the rich side of the flame, soot is displaced relative to curved mixture fraction iso-surfaces due to differential diffusion effects between soot and the gas-phase. Soot traveling towards the flame is oxidized, and aggregates displaced away from the flame grow primarily by condensation of PAH on the particle surface. In contrast to previous DNS studies based on simplified soot and chemistry models, surface reactions are found to contribute barely to the growth of soot, for nucleation and condensation processes occurring in the fuel stream are responsible for the most of soot mass generation. Furthermore, the morphology of the soot aggregates is found to depend on the location of soot in mixture fraction space. Aggregates having the largest primary particles populate the region closest to the location of peak soot growth. On the contrary, the aggregates with the largest number of primary particles are located much further into the fuel stream.},

  abstract = {A Global Pathway Selection (GPS) algorithm for the reduction of detailed kinetic mechanisms is proposed and validated. The approach consists of (1) the construction of element flux graphs for each considered element from the simulation data obtained using detailed chemical mechanisms, (2) the selection of important species that act as hubs that transfer significant element flux, and (3) the subsequent identification of the global pathway for each hub species by searching a certain number of shortest paths with the constructed element flux graphs from the initial reactants to the final products through the considered hub species. The skeletal mechanism is then obtained by removing the species and reactions that are not important to any identified global pathways. Validations are performed to generate skeletal mechanisms for the combustion of two fuels: n-dodecane, and the mixture of toluene, iso-octane, and n-heptane. For both cases, a series of mechanisms are generated using GPS, and the maximum error of ignition delays is similar or smaller comparing to the skeletal mechanisms generated using Path Flux Analysis method (Sun et al., 2010) with similar number of species. GPS is further compared with two methods using sensitivity analysis, which is usually effective but time consuming. By comparing simulation results of ignition delay, perfect stirred reactor (PSR) temperature, and laminar flame speed over a wide range of operating conditions, it is observed that a 35-species skeletal mechanism generated by GPS for n-dodecane shows similar overall accuracy compared with the 31-species skeletal mechanism obtained by Direct Relation Graph Aided Sensitivity Analysis (Vie et al., 2015). Further validation is conducted for the combustion of the mixture of toluene, n-heptane and iso-octane. A 276-species mechanism generated using DRG with error propagation followed by sensitivity analysis and reaction elimination (Niemeyer et al., 2014) shows larger errors for PSR temperature and ignition delay with fuel composition different from the raw database. However these errors can be reduced significantly if GPS-generated mechanism of similar size is tested.},

The parallel computing efficiency is investigated through numerical examples. Near 60% parallel efficiency is achieved for the maximum testing case with 3.7 million MC particles running on 93 parallel computing nodes. The algorithm is verified through simulating various testing cases and comparing the simulation results with available analytical and/or other numerical solutions. Generally, it is found that only small number (hundreds or thousands) of MC particles is necessary to accurately predict the aerosol particle number density, volume fraction, and so forth, that is, low order moments of the Particle Size Distribution (PSD) function. Accurately predicting the high order moments of the PSD needs to dramatically increase the number of MC particles. © 2014 Kun Zhou et al.},

  abstract      = {A large-scale simulation of aerosol nucleation and growth in a turbulent mixing layer is performed and analyzed with the aim of elucidating the key processes involved. A cold gaseous stream is mixed with a hot stream of vapor, nanometer sized droplets nucleate as the vapor becomes supersaturated, and subsequently grow as more vapor condenses on their surface. All length and time scales of fluid motion and mixing are resolved and the quadrature method of moments is used to describe the dynamics of the condensing, non-inertial droplets. The results showthat a region of high nucleation rate is located near the cold, dry stream, while particles undergo intense growth via condensation on the hot, humid vapor side. Supersaturation and residence times are such that number densities are low and neither coagulation nor vapor scavenging due to condensation are significant.The difference in Schmidt numbers of aerosol particles (approximated as infinity) and temperature and vapor (near unity) causes a drift of the aerosol particles in scalar space and contributes to a large scatter in the conditional statistics of aerosol quantities. The spatial distribution of the aerosol reveals high volume fraction on the hot side of the mixing layer. This distribution is due to drift against the mean and is related to turbulent mixing, which displaces particles from the nucleation region (cold side) into the growth region (hot side). Such a mechanism is absent in laminar flows and is a distinct feature of turbulent condensing aerosols. © 2014 AIP Publishing LLC.},

The attrition resulting from the bubbling fluidized bed regime progressively detaches the silica coating from the glass beads, giving rise to a steady production of silica nanosized aerosols with median diameters from 100 to 250 nm depending on the initial size of the coating nanoparticles. Continuous aerosol production could be maintained for more than 12 h, and the nanoparticle concentration can be easily tuned in the range of 2000 to 14,000 #/cm 3 by adjusting the fluidization and/or dilution flow rates.

  abstract      = {A mathematical model describing the vapor-phase synthesis of II-VI compound semiconductor nanoparticles in a counterflow jet reactor has been developed. The model was used to perform parametric studies in order to identify optimal operating conditions and reactor configurations that maximize particle yield, minimize polydispersity, and enable synthesis of particles with average size smaller than the quantum confinement threshold, i.e., quantum dots. The synthesis of zinc selenide nanoparticles by reacting vapors of dimethyl zinc with hydrogen selenide gas under isothermal conditions at 300 K was used as an example. In the experimental system, the two precursors were diluted in hydrogen carrier gas and each was fed into the reactor from a different inlet of an opposed-flow configuration. A steady-state reaction-transport model was developed to describe the laminar flow of the hydrogen carrier gas in the reactor, mass transfer of the precursors by convection and diffusion, and nucleation of particles through an irreversible reaction between the precursors. The reaction-transport model was coupled to an aerosol dynamics model describing particle transport by diffusion and convection, and particle growth by coagulation. The Galerkin finite element method was used to solve the resulting system of partial differential equations in the axial and radial directions of a cylindrical domain by assuming rotational symmetry. The only fitted parameter of the model was the activation energy for coagulation whose value was estimated by comparing model predictions with experimental data from a laboratory-scale reactor. A parametric study was performed to identify optimal operating conditions and a reactor configuration that maximizes particle yield, minimizes polydispersity, and enables the synthesis of particles with average size below the confinement threshold of 9 nm for zinc selenide. © 2011 American Chemical Society.},

  abstract      = {A mathematical model for predicting the fate of toxic heavy metals during combustion is presented. The model accounts for the formation of new particles through nucleation and the growth of existing particles through the combined effects of condensation and coagulation. A key simplification enabling the development of a usable methodology is the subdivision of the particle size distribution into just two modes, one comprising fine particles and the other coarse particles. The toxic heavy metal calculations are embodied in a post-processor appended to a parent code for the prediction of the aerodynamics and combustion. Three flames are studied for a coal fuel, sewage sludge fuel and a blend of these two fuels. The partitioning and emissions of the semi-volume metals, lead and cadmium, are predicted and compared with data collected in a large-scale laboratory combustor. The predicted metal enrichments on the small particles are remarkably well-predicted. However, it is concluded that heterogeneous condensation of the metal vapours alone is insufficient to explain fully the fate of metal vapours. Surface reaction and gas phase chemical reaction should also be considered, but the necessary chemical kinetic data are currently lacking. The results indicated that ash mineral matter, such as kaolinite, is an effective sorbent for lead, but not for cadmium. As expected, the coagulation of fine particles in influenced more by the particles number density than by combustion variables. It is also found that the scavenging of fine particles by coarse particles has little effect on the metal partitioning.},

Approximating the aerosol size distribution by a lognormal function and using the statistical method of moment, the evolution of the three aerosol moments and the mass balance equations for the two associated gases in the annular denuder system are obtained. The governing equations were cast into dimensionless form and the performance of the model was validated by the existing data available in the literature. The effects of governing dimensionless groups on the model performance were evaluated in the sensitivity analysis. The model was then applied for sampling nitric acid gas using a typical range of atmospheric aerosol and gas properties to derive the performance equation of the annular denuder system. The methodologies presented herein are helpful in providing design and operational criteria of the annular denuder system for a real sampling of atmospheric reactive gases that minimizes measurement artifacts. © 1995.},

The model has been used to analyze the mechanism of particle formation in the SAS process, and to study the effects of the operating parameters on particle size and solid recovery. The comparison with experimental results shows good agreement in the trends.

This allows the computation of discontinuous waves and their interactions with the accuracy of front-tracking algorithms. This is done without the use of additional grid points representing shocks, in contrast to conventional front-tracking schemes. The Lagrangian character of the present scheme also allows contact, discontinuities to be captured easily. The algorithm avoids interpolation across discontinuities in a natural and efficient way. The method has been used on a variety of reacting and non-reaching flows in order to test its ability to compute accurately and in a robust way complicated wave interactions.},

The gaseous binary diffusion coefficients of aromatics in common gases were calculated with Chapman-Enskog equation using the estimated Lennard-Jones parameters and were found to compare well with the available experimental data and the predictions of one of the most reliable empirical approximations.

The method employs the simplified approximation of fitting an equivalent ellipse. The effectiveness of the method is first evaluated by comparison with two types of manual assessment. It is then applied to assess the evolution of the soot sheet dimensions in two turbulent nonpremixed propane flames. These two flames, had the same fuel flow rates but different global mixing rates, were produced by a precessing jet (PJ) and a simple jet (SJ) burner. The global mixing rate of the flames was observed to affect the shape of probability density functions (PDFs) of soot sheets L and W. The shapes of the \{PDFs\} of the flames reveal that burnout of the soot sheets in the \{PJ\} and \{SJ\} flame proceeded predominantly through the reduction of the soot sheet dimensions, and the number of soot sheets, respectively. Finally, a convenient way to estimate the actual maximum width of the single-branched soot sheets is proposed, and this value is estimated to be ∼20 mm for both flames. },

While details are incomplete, the model is consistent with our knowledge of these processes and is supported by observations. Turbulence arises in a hot big-bang quantum gravitational dynamics scenario at Planck scales. Chaotic, eddy-like motions produce an exothermic Planck particle cascade from 10−35 m at 1032 K to 108 larger, 104 cooler, quark-gluon scales. A Planck-Kerr instability gives high Reynolds number (Re ∼ 106) turbulent combustion, space-time-energy-entropy and turbulent mixing. Batchelor-Obukhov-Corrsin turbulent-temperature fluctuations are preserved as the first fossil turbulence by inflation stretching the patterns beyond the horizon ct of causal connection faster than light speed c in time t∼ 10−33 sec. Fossil big-bang temperature turbulence reenters the horizon and imprints nucleosynthesis of H-He densities that seed fragmentation by gravity at 1012 s in the low Reynolds number plasma before its transition to gas at t∼ 1013 s and T∼ 3000 K.

In small particle regime, the size distributions and the time histories of the total number and volume per unit volume are reproduced by the moment method for the evaporation near the smallest size. In large particle regime, however, the differences between the moment and exact solutions are larger with time, after the exact distribution spreads to the smallest size. This new moment solver can reproduce the evaporation near the smallest size even when large time step size is given, and thus is expected to be used for the parameterization of the evaporation of small particles in aerosol-transport model.

The results of the moment model are in excellent agreement with the solution of Friedlander [Friedlander (1977) Smoke, Dust and Haze. Wiley, New York] for the limiting case of monodisperse aerosols in absence of coagulation. Deposition rates for polydisperse aerosols determined by the moment model are in good agreement with solutions obtained by integrating Friedlander's monodisperse aerosol results over the entire size distribution. Deposition rates have also been determined due to diffusion accounting for coagulation, and due to diffusion and thermophoresis accounting for coagulation having applicability in deposition of high concentration aerosols encountered in industrial systems such as manufacture of optical fibers by the OVD process or heat exchangers in boilers. © 1990.},

  abstract        = {A multitude of pharmaceutical substances are often insoluble or only slightly soluble in aqueous media and the application of oral or injectable drugs is often limited by its low bioavailability. A promising method to improve the bioavailability of pharmaceutical agents is the Rapid Expansion of Supercritical Solutions (RESS). The RESS-process enables the micronization of thermally labile materials and the formation of particles of less than 500 nm in diameter. Our current research is aimed towards an improved understanding of the relationship between process parameters and particle characteristics and to explore new areas of application for nanoscale particles. Therefore, experimental investigations and numerical simulations were performed. Measurements were carried out for Benzoic acid, the pharmaceuticals Griseofulvin and β-Sitosterol with the solvents CO2 (Carbon dioxide) and CHF3 (Trifluoromethane). These experiments led to particle sizes in the range of 200-500 nm depending on solvent and pre and postexpansion conditions. RESS-modelling is focused on the flow through the nozzle, the supersonic freejet, the Mach shock and particle growth in the expansion unit. From these calculations follows that particles are formed as small as 2-8 nm in the supersonic freejet. Hence, the conditions inside the expansion chamber are one key factor to control particle size. Furthermore, experiments show that the RESS processing of Griseofulvin leads to a significantly better dissolution rate of the drug resulting in an improved bioavailability. Moreover, stable suspensions of nanoscale particles of β-Sitosterol were produced by the rapid expansion of a supercritical mixture through a capillary nozzle into aqueous solutions. The particle sizes of β-Sitosterol in the aqueous solution were smaller or equal to those produced by RESS into air without the surfactant solution. © 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

This model resolves aerosol chemical composition, size distribution, mixing types, and shapes of fractal agglomerates in the atmosphere. These parameters are critical for accurate estimation of the hygroscopicity and optical properties of aerosols. The model implements a new aerosol dynamics module (Modal Aerosol Dynamics model for multiple Modes and fractal Shapes (MADMS)), which for the first time enables simulation of intermodal Brownian coagulation between two modes with very different size distributions using the modal moment approach. MADMS simulates Brownian coagulation for arbitrary fractal dimensions. Coagulation processes due to turbulence and sedimentation are also considered. The EMTACS model successfully reproduced the fractions of PM<inf>2.5</inf> to PM<inf>10</inf> of major inorganic aerosol components measured at Jeju Island in Korea in the spring of 2005 during the Atmospheric Brown Cloud-East Asian Regional Experiment 2005 (ABC-EAREX) campaign. The results indicate the capability of the model in interpreting the observed size distribution and mixing types of aerosol inorganic components. The spatial and temporal distribution of mixing types of inorganic components (nss-SO <inf>4</inf>2-, NO<inf>3</inf>-, and NH<inf>4</inf> +) during long-range transport in East Asia is also discussed.

  abstract        = {A new bimodal moment method for submicron fractal-like agglomerates undergoing Brownian coagulation is developed. The entire bimodal agglomerate size distribution is firstly separated into two separated distributions, where each distribution is represented by a population balance equation. The two joint population balance equations are then resolved by introducing the Taylor expansion method of moments (TEMOM). This newly developed bimodal model (B-TEMOM) is compared with the commonly used bimodal log-normal method of moments (B-log MM), and bimodal quadrature method of moments (B-QMOM) for the first three moments as well as geometric standard deviation of number distribution. Compared to the B-QMOM, the solution suggests that the B-TEMOM and the B-log MM produce much closer results. With the increase in the difference of the total particle number concentration, the geometric standard deviation, and the geometric mean volume of two modes, the difference among the investigated bimodal models is also slightly increased. The difference between B-log MM and B-TEMOM is found to increase with a decrease in mass fractal dimension, especially at a later stage in the evolution. The solution fully verifies that this newly developed B-TEMOM is reliable for predicting agglomerate dynamics undergoing Brownian coagulation in the continuum-slip regime. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {A new detailed chemical-kinetic Monte Carlo model of graphene-edge growth is presented. The model employs a fine-grained approach to chemically resolved species, allows for incorporation of five-member rings into growing structures, and links the stochastic kinetic steps to a geometry optimization, thereby properly accounting for curving of molecular structures. The evolving morphology is greatly affected by the rates of key reactions and hence by surface-site steric environment and gas-phase species concentrations. The evolving graphene morphology and growth rates seemingly reach "asymptotic" behavior, independent of the initial substrate. Most noteworthy, growing layers become significantly curved. The curvature occurs regardless of initial substrate at both 1500 and 2000 K with higher curvature occurring at the lower temperature. More intriguing is the observation that, at 2000 K, transition from planar to curved growth does not commence immediately but occurs at some later time, seemingly when the growing graphene reaches a size significantly larger than coronene. No curvature is produced in numerical simulations at 2500 K, indicating that high-energy environments cause the five-member-ring to be less stable, thus preventing them from forming. © 2010 American Chemical Society.},

We changed the fuel composition of the flamelet equation relative to the states of devolatilization and char combustion. In order to determine the fuel composition coming through the char combustion, all the gasified char was assumed to be converted into CO by the oxidation reaction. The validity of the developed flamelet model was examined in a simple two-dimensional pulverized coal jet field ignited by burnt co-flows. The accuracy of the model was evaluated by comparing its instantaneous distributions of temperature, CO2 mass fraction, and OH mass fraction with those of a detailed chemistry model. Good agreement was obtained in terms of the overall features of turbulent structures and combustion state, although the flamelet model showed slightly quicker ignition due to the transitional state in the ignition process being insufficiently reproducible.},

The characteristics method is used to predict droplet sizes within a discrete time step. The method is designed such that 1) a pre-specified number of moments of the droplet size distribution may be preserved, 2) there exists no time step stability restriction related to the condensation rate and section size, 3) highly skewed fixed sectional distributions may be used and 4) it is straightforward to extend to spatially inhomogeneous settings and to incorporate droplet coagulation and break-up. We derive, starting from mass conservation, a consistent internally mixed multi-species aerosol model. For certain condensational growth laws analytical solutions exist, against which the method is validated. Using two-moment and four-moment-preserving schemes, we find first order convergence of the numerical solution to the analytical result, as a function of the number of sections. As the four-moment-preserving scheme does not guarantee positivity of the solution, a hybrid scheme is proposed, which, when needed, locally reverts back to two-moment preservation, to prevent negativity. As an illustration, the method is applied to a complete multi-species homogeneous nucleation and condensation problem. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract = {A newly-developed detailed mechanism of soot oxidation was tested against experimental observations. The computations were performed at an atomistic level and with a detailed consideration of soot particle surface sites. Several additional reactions were investigated theoretically and one of them, oxidation of embedded five-member rings by O atoms, was included in the model. The primary focus of the study was on the high-temperature shock-tube experiments of Roth et al. (1991). The reaction model was able to reproduce the experimental results, but required coupling to particle nanostructure: partial oxidation of PAH molecules and the decrease in PAH initial sizes along the oxidation path. The principle reaction mechanism was identified to be the formation of oxyradicals, their decomposition, formation of hard-to-oxidize embedded five-member rings, and oxidation of the latter predominantly by O atoms. The analysis identified O as the most effective oxidizer of the embedded five-member rings, which thus controls the rate of the overall oxidation. The model thus predicts fast oxidation during a brief initial period followed by a slow-oxidation one. The model of partial oxidation of an aromatic molecule and switching to the next intact molecule suggests pore formation and subsequent inner particle burning. We also investigated the ability of the present model to reproduce recent measurements of soot oxidation rates performed by Camacho et al. (2015) at about 1000 K. The initial reaction model failed to predict these results, and no adjustment could reconcile the differences. The only way to bring the model to experimental values was by assuming a catalytic decomposition of water on the reactor wall supplying additional radicals, H and OH, to the reacting gas mixture. Additional chemistry, oxidation through complex formation at neighboring surface sites, was required to fully reproduce the experimental observations. These additional reactions were found to play no role in the high-temperature simulations, nor were they sufficient to reproduce the low-temperature experiment on their own, without the assumed catalytic decomposition of water.},

  abstract = {A non-dissipative, robust, implicit algorithm is proposed for direct numerical and large-eddy simulation of compressible turbulent flows. The algorithm addresses the problems caused by low Mach numbers and under-resolved high Reynolds numbers. It colocates variables in space to allow easy extension to unstructured grids, and discretely conserves mass, momentum and total energy. The Navier–Stokes equations are non-dimensionalized using an incompressible scaling for pressure, and the energy equation is used to obtain an expression for the velocity divergence. A pressure-correction approach is used to solve the resulting equations, such that the discrete divergence is constrained by the energy equation. As a result, the discrete equations analytically reduce to the incompressible equations at very low Mach number, i.e., the algorithm overcomes the acoustic time-scale limit without preconditioning or solution of an implicit system of equations. The algorithm discretely conserves kinetic energy in the incompressible inviscid limit, and is robust for inviscid compressible turbulence on the convective time-scale. These properties make it well-suited for DNS/LES of compressible turbulent flows. Results are shown for acoustic propagation, the incompressible Taylor problem, periodic shock tube problem, and isotropic turbulence.},

  abstract = {A nonreactive hot mixture of radiatively participating species, typically carbon dioxide and water vapor, may be found in the exhaust
sections of almost all combustors. Since the scalar fluctuations in such nonreactive flows are substantially smaller than in flames, it is commonly believed that the effects of turbulence-radiation interactions (TRI) on altering wall heat fluxes in nonreactive flows are negligible. Such belief, however, has not been substantiated by evidence to date. The purpose of this note is to investigate the conditions under which
TRI may be important in nonreactive flows. The final outcome was found to be largely dependent on how the scalar fluctuations correlate, rather than the magnitude of the fluctuations themselves. It was found that for most situations of practical interest, TRI effects are indeed negligible.},

In this model, here called ODTLES, 3D aspects of the flow are captured by embedding three, mutually orthogonal, one-dimensional ODT domain arrays within a coarser 3D mesh. The ODTLES model is obtained by developing a consistent approach for dynamically coupling the different ODT line sets to each other and to the large scale processes that are resolved on the 3D mesh. The model is implemented computationally and its performance is tested by performing simulations of decaying isotropic turbulence at two different Reynolds numbers and comparing to the experimental data of [H.

A one-step chemical kinetics approach is employed to model precursor TiCl4 oxidation that leads to particle formation. An efficient quadrature method of moments (QMOM) and the combustion model based on the eddy dissipation concept (EDC) together with k - ε{lunate} turbulence model are used to approximate the particle kinetics evolution and the flame fields, respectively. Excellent agreements between the predicted and experimental data, with respect to the flame temperature distribution and particle kinetics, are obtained. For the final product of nanoparticles in the same flame field, the results show that the increasing of precursor loading leads to the larger agglomerated particles with larger size distribution. The primary particle number and size per agglomerate also increases with increasing the precursor loading, while the total specific surface area (SSA) decreases. The variation of inlet precursor loading has a negligible effect on the particle surface fractal dimension if only the variable of precursor loading is considered. As the inlet precursor loading is fixed, the increasing of carrying gas rate leads to the smaller agglomerated particles with increasing of total SSA and width of particle size distribution. © 2007.},

Considering the complete expansion of the fluid into a vacuum, the process is modeled as inviscid, radial flow. The particulate material is described by the moments of the particle size distribution by numerically integrating the moments with the equations describing an inviscid flow of a non-ideal solution. By varying the initial process conditions, we examine the trends due to changes in specific operational parameters for typical RESS solutions. These calculations show that in the limit of a very rapid expansion with no precipitation in the nozzle itself, an increase in solute concentration produces a large increase in the particle size of the solids produced. Increasing the initial temperature causes a decrease in the calculated mean particle size, while an increase in pressure produces larger particles. However, both temperature and pressure have a much smaller effect on the calculated particle sizes than does concentration. The calculations demonstrate that small particles with a narrow size distribution can be achieved by using as low a solute concentration as possible and operating at relatively low preexpansion pressures and high preexpansion temperatures. © 1995.},

A detailed chemical kinetic model of particle nucleation was coupled to an aerosol dynamics model that includes particle growth by surface reactions, coagulation with instantaneous coalescence, and convective transport. Solution of the aerosol general dynamic equation was handled by three approaches: (1) the efficient and reasonably accurate method of moments; (2) the quadrature method of moments, which requires no prior assumption of the shape of the particle size distribution; and (3) a computationally more expensive sectional method (SM). The SM includes a conceptually simple and computationally efficient algorithm for treating coagulation that is found to be superior to widely used methods from the literature. All three approaches gave similar results for the evolution of the first few moments of the particle size distribution. The SM was able to capture the bimodal distribution that appears briefly at short residence times due to simultaneous nucleation and coagulation. At longer residence time, only coagulation remains important and both the sectional and moment methods give very similar results as they approach the self-preserving size distribution. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The model includes a detailed clustering mechanism for the formation of hydrogenated silicon clusters containing up to ten silicon atoms. This mechanism was coupled to an aerosol dynamics moment model to predict particle growth, coagulation, and transport. Both zero-dimensional transient simulations, at 1-2 atm pressure, and one-dimensional steady-state stagnation-point flow simulations, at 1-2 Torr pressure, were conducted. The effects of carrier gas, temperature, pressure, silane concentration, and flow rate were examined. The results predict that hydrogen as carrier gas, compared to helium, suppresses nucleation, and that particle formation for the case of hydrogen carrier gas increases strongly with increasing initial silane-to-hydrogen ratio. For the conditions examined, predicted particle nucleation rates increase dramatically with increasing temperature. The effect of total pressure depends on the pressure regime: at 1-2 atm pressure particle formation is predicted to be insensitive to pressure, whereas at 1-2 Torr particle formation is predicted to increase strongly with increasing pressure. The predicted effects on particle formation of temperature, pressure, carrier gas, and silane concentration are all qualitatively consistent with published experimental results. In the stagnation-point flow simulations the flow rate is found to affect particle dynamics because of the opposed effects of convective transport toward the heated water and thermophoretic transport away from the wafer.},

A modified two-equation soot model was employed to describe soot nucleation, growth and oxidation. Interaction between the gas-phase chemistry and soot chemistry was taken into account. Radiation heat transfer by both soot and radiating gases was calculated using the discrete-ordinates method coupled with a statistical narrow-band correlated-k based band model, and was used to evaluate the simple optically thin approximation. The governing equations in fully elliptic form were solved. The current models in the literature describing soot oxidation by O2 and OH have to be modified in order to predict the smoking flame. The modified soot oxidation model has only moderate effects on the calculation of the non-smoking flame, but dramatically affects the soot oxidation near the flame tip in the smoking flame. Numerical results of temperature, soot volume fraction and primary soot particle size and number density were compared with experimental data in the literature. Relatively good agreement was found between the prediction and the experimental data. The optically thin approximation radiation model significantly underpredicts temperatures in the upper portion of both flames, seriously affecting the soot prediction.},

Flame 150 (2007) 108-126] is used to study the soot formation in a non-premixed turbulent flame. The model allows coupling between reaction, diffusion and soot (including soot diffusion and thermophoretic forces) processes in the subgrid domain without requiring ad hoc filtering or model parameter adjustments. The combined model includes the entire process, from the initial phase, when the soot nucleus diameter is much smaller than the mean free path, to the final phase, after coagulation and aggregation, where it can be considered in the continuum regime. A relatively detailed but reduced kinetics for ethylene-air is used to simulate an experimentally studied non-premixed ethylene/air jet diffusion flame. Acetylene is used as a soot precursor species. The soot volume fraction order of magnitude, the location of its maxima, and the soot particle size distribution are all captured reasonably. Along the centerline, an initial region dominated by nucleation and surface growth is established followed by an oxidation region. The diffusion effect is found to be most important in the nucleation regime, while the thermophoretic forces become more influential downstream of the potential core in the oxidation zone. The particle size distribution shows a log-normal distribution in the nucleation region, and a more Gaussian like distribution further downstream. Limitations of the current approach and possible solution strategies are also discussed. © 2008 The Combustion Institute.},

Broadening of the reactive layer is then mandatory to ensure a proper propagation of the filtered flame front. The reactive flow governing equations exhibit then two filter operators of different sizes dedicated to the flow field and the flame front, respectively. The consistency issues between flame and flow filter sizes in LES of turbulent premixed flames are discussed in the present article. A general mathematical formalism considering two different filter sizes is proposed. A new closure of the resulting LES balance equations system is derived in the framework of the Filtered TAbulated Chemistry for LES (F-TACLES) formalism. The new model, called F2-TACLES, is first validated by computing 1-D premixed filtered flames. Then an LES of the complex turbulent premixed PRECCINSTA swirl burner is successfully performed. In particular, the new model formulation improves the prediction of resolved flame/turbulence interactions.},

  abstract = {A semiempirical model has been developed for predicting coal-derived soot. The main feature of the model is a transport equation for soot mass fraction. Tar prediction options include either an empirical or a transport equation approach, which directly impacts the source term for soot formation. Also, the number of soot particles per unit mass of gas may be calculated using either a transport equation or an assumed average. Kinetics are based on Arrhenius rates taken from published measurements. Radiative properties are calculated as a function of averaged optical constants, predicted gas temperatures, predicted gas densities, and the soot mass fractions. This model has been incorporated into a comprehensive coal modeling code and evaluated based on comparisons with soot, temperature, and NOx measurements for three experimental cases. Accurate predictions of soot yields have been achieved for both laminar and turbulent coal flames. Larger scale turbulent predictions illustrated that inclusion of a soot model changed the local gas temperatures by as much as 300 K and the local NOx concentration by as much as 250 ppm. These predictions demonstrate the necessity for an accurate soot model in coal combustion systems.},

The model is evaluated against detailed measurements in a two-dimensional laminar diffusion flame on a Wolfhard-Parker burner. The freestream compositions are modified to raise the stoichiometric condition (ζst = 0.475), thereby adjusting the flame shape to make the burn-out regime readily accessible to measurement and to substantially raise the temperature levels throughout the flame—peak measured temperature was ≈ 2550 K. These temperatures are more relevant to many practical systems than those typically realized in small-scale laminar flame experiments and therefore provide some insight into the extrapolation necessary for practical application. The principal oxidizing species is shown to be the hydroxyl radical, introduced into the prediction from a flamelet calculation as a function of the mixture fraction, the characteristic scalar variable for the complete composition field. The simplified representation of sooting processes in terms of volume fraction and number density is then readily adapted to incorporate soot oxidation and is shown to satisfactorily embrace the enhanced temperature range.},

The initial SO3 conversion rate at the engine exhaust plane was systematically varied to evaluate its effects on aerosol density and surface density distributions in the jet plume. The model shows reasonable predictions of aerosol number density, aerosol surface density, and critical gas species in the near-field plume. There is a significant discrepancy in the predicted aerosol number density in the jet plume when microscale mixing is neglected. Results show that peak number density is underpredicted by about 40% without micromixing, which suggests that the mixing process in the engine plume could have a nonnegligible impact on the overall aerosol distribution. The computational efficiency of the aerosol model developed here also provides a framework for incorporating aerosol dynamics into large-eddy simulation models for three-dimensional simulations of near-field plume-vortex interactions.},

The soot model has 36 soot nucleation reactions from 8 PAH molecules including pyrene and larger PAHs. Soot surface growth reactions were based on a modified hydrogen-abstraction-acetylene-addition (HACA) mechanism in which CH3, C3H3 and C2H radicals were included in the hydrogen abstraction reactions in addition to H atoms. PAH condensation on soot particles was also considered. The experimentally measured profiles of soot volume fraction, number density, and particle size were well captured by the model for the baseline case of ethylene along with the cases involving mixtures of fuels. The simulation results, which were in qualitative agreement with the experimental data in the effects of binary fuel mixing on the sooting structures of the measured flames, showed in particular that 5% addition of propane (ethane) led to an increase in the soot volume fraction of the ethylene flame by 32% (6%), despite the fact that propane and ethane are less sooting fuels than is ethylene, which is in reasonable agreement with experiments of 37% (14%). The model revealed that with 5% addition of methane, there was an increase of 6% in the soot volume fraction. The average soot particle sizes were only minimally influenced while the soot number densities were increased by the fuel mixing. Further analysis of the numerical data indicated that the chemical cross-linking effect between ethylene and the dopant fuels resulted in an increase in PAH formation, which led to higher soot nucleation rates and therefore higher soot number densities. On the other hand, the rates of soot surface growth per unit surface area through the HACA mechanism were similar among the different fuel mixing cases, although slightly lower compared with ethylene base case. The increased soot nucleation rates by fuel mixing and similar soot surface growth rates (per unit surface area) help to explain the increased soot volume fraction/number density and similar average sizes among the tested cases.},

The performance of the proposed method is compared with that of the stochastic full-spectrum k-distribution (FSK) method in both homogeneous and inhomogeneous media, and in both traditional continuum media and media represented by stochastic particle fields, which are frequently encountered in combustion simulations. By using random-number relations, the \{LBL\} method does its own spectral reordering, in effect similar to the \{FSK\} reordering. Both \{LBL\} and \{FSK\} methods result in the same level of statistical errors for similar numbers of photon bundles. It is shown that the \{FSK\} approach is superior to the \{LBL\} approach in both memory and \{CPU\} efficiency in all test cases. However, the \{CPU\} efficiency is not prominent when spectral calculations are not the dominant source of overall CPU-time cost. Due to a lack of correlation of absorption coefficients in inhomogeneous media, the \{FSK\} approach may produce substantial errors, which are avoided by the \{LBL\} method. The \{LBL\} database can be constructed once and for all, while the \{FSK\} database has to be reconstructed every time the reference state changes. Thus, the \{LBL\} method is more suitable for quickly-evolving media. },

The mixing rates are varied by adjusting the velocity and length scales of the stagnation flow parametrically. The effect of mixing rates on particle concentration, polydispersity, and mean droplet diameter is explored and discussed. This numerical study reveals a complex response of the aerosol to varying flow times. Depending on the flow time, the variation of the particle concentration in response to varying mixing rates falls into one of the two regimes. For fast mixing rates, the number density and volume fraction of the condensing particles increase with residence time (nucleation regime). On the contrary, for low mixing rates, number density decreases with residence time and volume fraction reaches a plateau (condensation regime). It is shown that vapor scavenging by the aerosol phase is key to explaining the transition between these two regimes. The results reported here are general and illustrate genuine features of the evolution of aerosols forming by condensation of supersaturated vapor from heat and mass transport across mixing layers. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.Allrightsreserved.},

  abstract = {A stochastic model, implemented as a Monte Carlo simulation, is used to compute statistical properties of velocity and scalar fields in stationary and decaying homogeneous turbulence, shear flow, and various buoyant stratified flows. Turbulent advection is represented by a random sequence of maps applied to a one-dimensional computational domain. Profiles of advected scalars and of one velocity component evolve on this domain. The rate expression governing the mapping sequence reflects turbulence production mechanisms. Viscous effects are implemented concurrently. Various flows of interest are simulated by applying appropriate initial and boundary conditions to the velocity profile. Simulated flow microstructure reproduces the −5&sol;3 power-law scaling of the inertial-range energy spectrum and the dissipation-range spectral collapse based on the Kolmogorov microscale. Diverse behaviours of constant-density shear flows and buoyant stratified flows are reproduced, in some instances suggesting new interpretations of observed phenomena. Collectively, the results demonstrate that a variety of turbulent flow phenomena can be captured in a concise representation of the interplay of advection, molecular transport, and buoyant forcing.},

A relatively detailed multispecies ethylene–air kinetics for gas phase combustion is used here to study the effect of inflow turbulence, the carbon–oxygen (C/O) ratio, and multicomponent species diffusion coefficients on soot production in turbulent premixed flames. The results show that soot formation occurs when the C/O ratio is above the critical value, in good agreement with past observations. Furthermore, we observe that turbulence increases the collision frequency between the soot particles. As a result, the coagulation rate increases and the total average surface area of the soot particles per unit volume decreases. In addition, the rate of surface growth decreases with the increase in the turbulence intensity. Finally, the inclusion of species transport properties is shown to affect the general structure of the flame in the form of wider curvature probability density function tails and higher turbulent flame speed. In addition, the effect on the relative thermal to molecular diffusivity at the subgrid level (Lewis number effect) changes the surface growth rate and the soot production level.},

We describe and characterize a simple set-up based on aerosol formation by homogeneous nucleation of an organic vapour and subsequent growth by Brownian coagulation in a closed chamber. Controlling parameters are the coagulation time and, to a much lesser extent, the volume fraction of the condensed aerosol. The system can be used in a time window starting from 100 s, the time required to reach the asymptotic state, and ending at 1000 s after initiation of the nucleation process, beyond which wall losses become significant. In this regime, the temporal development of the number concentration in the coagulation vessel is exclusively determined by the physical process of Brownian coagulation.

  abstract = {A systematic assessment of the submodels of conditional moment closure (CMC) formalism for the autoignition problem is carried out using direct numerical simulation (DNS) data. An initially non-premixed, n-heptane/air system, subjected to a three-dimensional, homogeneous, isotropic and decaying turbulence, is considered. Two kinetic schemes, (1) a one-step and (2) a reduced four-step reaction mechanism, are considered for chemistry. An alternative formulation is developed for closure of the mean chemical source term (w/ν), based on the condition that the instantaneous fluctuation of excess, temperature is small. With this model, it is shown that the CMC equations describe the autoignition process all the way up to near the equilibrium limit. The effect of second-order terms (namely, conditional variance of temperature excess δ2 and conditional correlations of species qij) in modeling (w/η) is examined. Comparison with DNS data shows that δ2 has little effect on the predicted conditional mean temperature evolution, if the average conditional scalar dissipation rate (N/η) is properly modeled. Using DNS data, a correction factor is introduced in the modeling of nonlinear terms (YiYj/η) to include the effect of species fluctuations. Computations including such a correction factor show that the species conditional correlations qij have little effect on model predictions with a one-step reaction, but those qij involving in termediate species are found to be crucial when four-step reduced kinetics is considered. The “most reactive mixture fraction” is found to vary with time when a four-step kinetics is considered. First-order CMC results are found to be qualitatively wrong if the conditional mean scalar dissipation rate is not modeled properly. The autoignition delay time predicted by the CMC model compares excellently with DNS results and shows a trend similar to experimental data over a range of initial temperatures.},

  abstract = {A tabulated closure based on conditional statistics from fully-resolved one-dimensional scalar profiles has been formulated for application using the large eddy simulation technique. These scalar profiles are obtained from both experiments (i.e., line imaging of Raman/Rayleigh/CO-LIF) and from the simulations of linear eddy model. Such profiles provide a local description of species and temperature evolution due to the full range of turbulent scales in the predominant direction of scalar transport. Instantaneous realizations of these scalar profiles are processed as a function of pre-determined filter widths in space to obtain the conditional statistics of filtered scalars. Key statistical quantities needed for LES, are then parameterized as a function of a unique filtered state vector. Here, we use the filtered mixture fraction Z∼, filtered scalar dissipation rate χ∼, and the subgrid Reynolds number ReΔ as the filtered state vector. Conditional PDF’s of temperature P(T|Z∼,χ∼,ReΔ), species mass fractions P(Yi|Z∼,χ∼,ReΔ), and relevant thermodynamic and transport properties are tabulated as a function of Z∼, χ∼, and ReΔ. A thermo-chemical state library is then constructed in a manner directly analogous to the conventional flamelet-library approach. The potentially novel feature of this approach is that the relation between filtered and instantaneous quantities is known directly. This eliminates the need for a posteriori models that link these quantities. An a priori analysis of the proposed model was carried out for non-premixed combustion using measurements obtained from CH4/H2/N2 jet flames at a Reynolds numbers of 15,200. This flame exhibits an interesting range of Damköhler and Schmidt numbers through local extinction, reignition, and differential diffusion. Results show good quantitative agreement with measurements.},

  abstract = {A transported joint probability density function (JPDF) approach closed at the joint scalar level has been applied to investigate two nonpiloted CH4/H2/N2 turbulent (Re≃15200 and 22800) jet diffusion flames. The flames have been studied experimentally at the Deutsches Zentrum für Luft- und Raumfahrt (DLR) and at Sandia National Laboratories and are well characterized experimentally through extensive velocity and scalar measurements. The flames offer the opportunity of computational investigations of turbulence–chemistry interactions in CH4/H2 flames in the absence of both partial premixing with air and with a smaller stoichiometric mixture fraction (Zst=0.167) than in the corresponding piloted Sandia flames. The two flames also offer different levels of local extinction. Comparatively few theoretical studies have been performed of these flames and the present work provides an assessment of the ability of the transported PDF approach to reproduce their detailed thermochemical structure. The chemical closure is obtained through a systematically reduced C/H/O/N mechanism featuring 16 independent, 4 dependent, and 28 steady-state scalars. The velocity field is computed using the second moment closure of Speziale et al. and molecular mixing is modeled using the modified Curl's model. It is shown that velocity and scalar fields are generally well reproduced for 10⩽x/D⩽80 though uncertainties in boundary conditions have an impact closer to the burner exit.},

The performance of MBHM was evaluated against double-moment sectional (DMS) models with coarse (BIN4) to very fine (BIN256) size resolutions for simulating evolution of particles under simultaneously occurring nucleation, condensation, and coagulation processes (BINx resolution uses x sections to cover the 1 nm to 1 μm size range). Because MBHM gives a physically consistent form of the intrasectional distributions, errors and biases of MBHM at BIN4-8 resolution were almost equivalent to those of DMS at BIN16-32 resolution for various important variables such as the moments M<inf>k</inf> (k: 0, 2, 3), dM<inf>k</inf>/dt, and the number and volume of particles larger than a certain diameter. Another important feature of MBHM is that only a single bin is adequate to simulate full aerosol dynamics for particles whose size distribution can be approximated by a single lognormal mode. This flexibility is useful for process-oriented (multicategory and/or mixing state) modeling: Primary aerosols whose size parameters would not differ substantially in time and space can be expressed by a single or a small number of modes, whereas secondary aerosols whose size changes drastically from 1 to several hundred nanometers can be expressed by a number of modes. Added dimensions can be applied to MBHM to represent mixing state or photochemical age for aerosol mixing state studies.

  abstract = {A turbulent nonpremixed bluff body ethylene flame is studied both experimentally and computationally. Experimentally, the soot volume fraction is measured using laser-induced incandescence (LII). Three distinct regions are observed in the flame: a low-strain recirculation zone, a downstream jet-like region, and a high-strain neck region connecting these two regions. The maximum soot volume fraction is found in the recirculation zone, but most of the soot volume is contained in the larger jet-like region further downstream. In the neck region between these two zones, soot cannot form due to large strain rates, and the small amounts of soot in this region indicate that soot rarely escapes the recirculation zone before being oxidized. The recirculation zone is characterized by a low soot intermittency, in contrast to the downstream jet-like region and previously investigated jet flames in which the soot intermittency is high. Large Eddy Simulation (LES) is used to further investigate this distinctly different evolution of soot in the recirculation zone. The \{LES\} model is found to predict the soot volume fraction profiles quite accurately, albeit with significant sensitivity to the inflow profiles of the fuel jet and air coflow. Soot is formed near the inner shear layer between the fuel jet and recirculation zone where the mixture fraction is sufficiently large to support Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbon (PAH) formation. A portion of this soot is entrained into the interior of the recirculation zone where the soot growth rates are relatively low, despite the rich mixture fraction in this region. The circulation vortex then transports the soot from the interior of the recirculation zone toward less rich mixture fractions near the flame, which is situated in the outer shear layer between the air coflow and the recirculation zone. Here, the majority of soot growth occurs due to surface growth, that is, mass addition due to surface reactions with acetylene. The dominance of acetylene-based surface growth in the recirculation zone contrasts findings in previous simulations of turbulent jet flames that do not exhibit a recirculation zone, in which nucleation and \{PAH\} condensation were found to overwhelm acetylene-based surface growth.},

A dimensionless discrete-sectional model for free-molecular aerosol coagulation is developed and systematically validated by examining the effects of section spacing and numerically conserved aerosol property (particle number, volume, and volume squared concentration) used in computing the evolution of the particle size distribution. Discrete-sectional models that numerically conserve the highest moment of the distribution (here, volume squared) most accurately predict the particle size distribution. This υ2-based model is used to develop a self-preserving map in the process parameter space of dimensionless time for chemical reaction, θ, and dimensionless process residence time, X. The self-preserving map defines a priori conditions for generation of powders having their asymptotic self-preserving size distribution. If the reaction is nearly instantaneous (θ ≤ 0.25), the time required for the distribution to become self-preserving is four times the characteristic time for monomer coagulation (X ≈ 4); however, as the reaction becomes slower (θ ≥ 0.25), the time for the distribution to become self-preserving is approximately 15 times the characteristic time for chemical reaction (X ≈ 15θ). The predictions of the present discrete-sectional model are compared against moment models for aerosol coagulation that assume that the particle size distribution remains monodisperse, self-preserving, or lognormally shaped throughout the process. © 1990.},

The model employed herein solves the full set of conservation equations for mass, momentum, energy, and species on a one-dimensional domain corresponding to the transverse jet direction. The effects of turbulent mixing are modeled via a stochastic process, while the full range of diffusive-reactive length and time scales are resolved directly on the one-dimensional domain. A detailed chemical mechanism consisting of 11 species and 21 reactions and mixture-averaged transport is used in this study (consistent with DNS simulations). Comparisons between the model and DNS data in physical and state space are shown, including conditional statistics. Results indicate that the model accurately reproduces the DNS data set. Turbulence-chemistry interactions, including trends for extinction and reignition, are captured by the model. Differences observed between model prediction and data are the result of early excess extinction observed in the model. The reasons for the early extinction are discussed within the model context.},

  abstract = {Abstract \{HRTEM\} fringe analysis by means of our “Analyse Plan” (AP) tool and a new \{HRTEM\} image analysis procedure, based on mathematical morphological analysis (MA), was applied to soot sampled along the axis of sooting premixed benzene and ethylene flames. The layer length obtained by means of \{MA\} approach was found to be higher in respect to the layer length derived from \{AP\} method, as it better accounts for their local curvature and distortion. The mean layer length obtained by the \{MA\} method was then proved to agree well with the data evaluated by Raman spectroscopy. Moreover, the \{MA\} method was useful for extracting other soot nanostructural parameters related to the geometry of individual fringes as layer length, tortuosity, and local curvature radii, in turn correlated with the defective nature of soot structure. Some parameters provided by the \{MA\} method appeared to be more sensitive and informative about structural changes occurring as soot is formed. In particular, the percentage of fringes with high tortuosity and the percentage of nearly-straight fragments were found to decrease and increase, respectively, throughout the soot formation region. These trends suggested a better stacking of longer and more planar layers testifying the structural order improvement with soot aging. It was also observed that the soot nanostructural ordering occurred faster for benzene with respect to ethylene soot in agreement with H/C and absorption coefficients trends. The distributions of carbon in differently-sized aromatic structures were evaluated on the basis of the fringe length distribution to follow the aromatic growth. The method assigned aromatic sizes to the extracted \{HRTEM\} fringes, assuming that the fringes are in the shape of parallelograms. The distributions were found to evolve toward larger size aromatic systems demonstrating the occurrence of aromatic growth during soot formation. },

In this model, radiation is treated from the \{CK\} approach and a Monte Carlo transfer method; the flow by a Direct Numerical Simulation. Both the effects of turbulence on radiation fields and of radiation on turbulent fields are accounted for. Gas–gas and gas–wall radiation interactions generate antagonist effects on the temperature and flux fields. The first one tends to increase wall conductive flux while the second one to decrease it. Consequently, the structure of the temperature field and the wall conductive flux often strongly differ from results without radiation. Classical wall log-laws for temperature are then strongly modified by the global radiation effects. Many conditions encountered in applications are discussed in the paper. The observed modifications depend on all the set of conditions (temperature level, wall emissivity, pressure, Reynolds number), i.e. on the relative magnitudes of radiation gas–gas and gas–wall phenomena and of global radiation flux and conductive flux without radiation. },

The gas-phase model (Ranzi et al., 2012) was expanded to include the chemistry of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAHs) up to four-to-five ring PAHs, with a modular and hierarchical approach. The discrete sectional method was employed to solve the size evolution of the particle size distribution function (PSDF). Analogy and similarity rules were employed to describe heterogeneous reaction kinetics of soot surface reactions. A variable collision efficiency was assumed for the coalescence of small soot particles. Larger particles were assumed to undergo aggregation. The predicted \{PSDFs\} are found to be in reasonably good agreement with the experimental data for nascent soot measured in an atmospheric-pressure premixed ethylene–oxygen–argon flame in the burner-stabilized stagnation flame configuration. Sensitivity analyses of the PSDF, number density, and volume fraction were carried out with respect to the rate parameters of addition reactions of acetylene, PAHs, resonantly stabilized radical reactions, and coalescence and aggregation. The results show that the reaction of \{PAHs\} and acetylene with soot surfaces and the kinetics of coalescence and aggregation exhibit dominant effects on the detailed and global soot properties for the flame studied, in agreement with conclusions of a large range of previous modeling studies. },

The hybrid approach, combining a large-eddy simulation and a computational aeroacoustic method, introduces spurious noise which can pollute the acoustic results. All relevant sources of spurious noise are analyzed, and a physics-based low-pass filter is proposed which eliminates spurious noise due to the convection of acoustic sources. The numerical predictions for both statistical flow field quantities and acoustic results have been validated with experimental data.

  abstract = {Abstract A modeling framework based on Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) is employed to simulate the evolution of the soot particle size distribution in turbulent sooting flames. The stochastic reactor describes the evolution of soot in fluid parcels following Lagrangian trajectories in a turbulent flow field. The trajectories are sampled from a Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS) of a n-heptane turbulent nonpremixed flame. The \{DSMC\} method is validated against experimentally measured size distributions in laminar premixed flames and found to reproduce quantitatively the experimental results, including the appearance of the second mode at large aggregate sizes and the presence of a trough at mobility diameters in the range 3–8 nm. The model is then applied to the simulation of soot formation and growth in simplified configurations featuring a constant concentration of soot precursors and the evolution of the size distribution in time is found to depend on the intensity of the nucleation rate. Higher nucleation rates lead to a higher peak in number density and to the size distribution attaining its second mode sooner. The ensemble-averaged \{PSDF\} in the turbulent flame is computed from individual samples of the \{PSDF\} from large sets of Lagrangian trajectories. This statistical measure is equivalent to time-averaged, scanning mobility particle size (SMPS) measurements in turbulent flames. Although individual trajectories display strong bimodality as in laminar flames, the ensemble-average \{PSDF\} possesses only one mode and a long, broad tail, which implies significant polydispersity induced by turbulence. Our results agree very well with \{SMPS\} measurements available in the literature. Conditioning on key features of the trajectory, such as mixture fraction or radial locations does not reduce the scatter in the size distributions and the ensemble-averaged \{PSDF\} remains broad. The results highlight and explain the important role of turbulence in broadening the size distribution of particles in turbulent sooting flames.},

  abstract = {Abstract A novel sectional approach for the modeling of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is presented. The \{PAH\} model includes \{PAH\} radicals and is based on a reversible \{PAH\} growth mechanism. Combustion of species up to benzene and toluene is treated by finite-rate chemistry. The soot particle size distribution (PSD) is discretized by a sectional approach. Soot, PAHs, and the thermo-chemical state of the gas phase are fully coupled by a simultaneous solution of all governing equations. The new \{PAH\} model has been validated for a series of combustion configurations and shows significant improvements compared to irreversible \{PAH\} models at basically no increase in computational cost. Compared to irreversible \{PAH\} models, soot nucleation is significantly slower, yielding a better agreement to measured soot volume fractions in a series of laminar premixed flames. Moreover, the model developments led to correct predictions of the temperature dependency of the soot yield in ethylene pyrolysis after reflected shock waves. Finally, it will be shown that the new model describes the influence of the equivalence ratio on soot \{PSD\} functions correctly.},

  abstract = {Abstract A semi-implicit preconditioned iterative method is proposed for the time-integration of the stiff chemistry in simulations of unsteady reacting flows, such as turbulent flames, using detailed chemical kinetic mechanisms. Emphasis is placed on the simultaneous treatment of convection, diffusion, and chemistry, without using operator splitting techniques. The preconditioner corresponds to an approximation of the diagonal of the chemical Jacobian. Upon convergence of the sub-iterations, the fully-implicit, second-order time-accurate, Crank–Nicolson formulation is recovered. Performance of the proposed method is tested theoretically and numerically on one-dimensional laminar and three-dimensional high Karlovitz turbulent premixed n-heptane/air flames. The species lifetimes contained in the diagonal preconditioner are found to capture all critical small chemical timescales, such that the largest stable time step size for the simulation of the turbulent flame with the proposed method is limited by the convective CFL, rather than chemistry. The theoretical and numerical stability limits are in good agreement and are independent of the number of sub-iterations. The results indicate that the overall procedure is second-order accurate in time, free of lagging errors, and the cost per iteration is similar to that of an explicit time integration. The theoretical analysis is extended to a wide range of flames (premixed and non-premixed), unburnt conditions, fuels, and chemical mechanisms. In all cases, the proposed method is found (theoretically) to be stable and to provide good convergence rate for the sub-iterations up to a time step size larger than 1 μs. This makes the proposed method ideal for the simulation of turbulent flames. },

  abstract = {Abstract A sooting C2H4/air jet diffusion flame was investigated experimentally by laser measuring techniques and the results are compared to CFD calculations. The target flame (C2H4 10.4g/min, bulk exit velocity 44m/s, RE=10,000) exhibits well-defined boundary conditions and presents a good test case for model validation. Flow velocity, temperature and soot volume fraction in this flame has been measured previously. In this paper, further experimental results from Raman scattering and laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) measurements are presented to expand the validation data base. Raman scattering is used to measure the fuel/air mixing prior to combustion, while LIF of PAHs monitors the soot precursor region and successive planar OH–LIF serves to map the flame front position and its statistics. Furthermore, a numerical simulation of this flame was performed based on the DLR in-house code THETA. Within the scope of the test case presented here, the code combines a relatively detailed description of the gas phase kinetics coupled with a detailed yet computation-efficient soot model, suitable for CFD applications. This model has been designed to predict soot for a variety of fuels and flames with good accuracy at relatively low computational costs. Universal model parameters are applied, which requires no tuning for the dependence of test case or fuel. The experimental and numerical results are compared and discussed with special emphasis on the pre-flame region of the jet and up to the downstream position where significant soot concentrations are present. Validation shows the general applicability of the CFD code with implemented soot model to rather complex systems like the target sooting turbulent jet flame. Identified discrepancies are analyzed and can be explained, while opening up the field for future optimization of parts of the CFD code.},

  abstract = {Abstract A transient mathematical model was developed to describe soot formation during the combustion of single coal particles based on the static semi-empirical model presented by Fletcher and coworkers. Sensitivity analyses of the model parameters show that soot emissivity and mass diffusivity of tar play an important role in predicting soot volume fraction (fv) and flame temperature (Tf). The model was applied to simulate the combustion of single bituminous coal particles with initial diameter (2r0) of 83 µm in a drop tube furnace and air atmosphere. It was found that soot is only formed within the first ∼ 5 ms after the appearance of the volatile flame. Although most of the soot is oxidized during the volatile flame phase, a small portion of soot still remains during the char combustion. Due to the soot presence, the volatile flame duration is extended by 2.6 ms. Compared with the soot-free flame, the sooting flame has remarkable lower Tf and its peak Tf value is ∼ 410 K lower. As a consequence, char combustion starts at a temperature that is ∼ 125 K lower than that of the soot-free case. Spatially, the peak fv at 16.6 ms appears at 4.5 r0 and soot oxidation zone spans to ∼ 10 r0. The model was validated by comparing the predicted Tf and fv under different \{O2\} mole fractions (xO2) with recent experimental results reported by Khatami and coworkers. The predicted trends are consistent with those of the experimental results. With increasing xO2, Tf increases, but the increase rate becomes more gradual at a large xO2. While for fv, a non-monotonic variation is observed, where soot first increases and then decreases with a peak value occurring at xO2 ≈ 40%. },

The investigation is carried out at a constant laminar flame speed, varying heat losses, jet Reynolds number, fuel molecular weight, and fuel chemical classification. Large Eddy Simulations are performed in an attempt to reproduce the behaviors observed experimentally. Simulations are compared against well-characterized boundary conditions, well-resolved two-dimensional velocity fields from particle image velocimetry, and line-of-sight CH⁎ profiles. Experimental results indicate that small amounts of heat losses may play a significant role on the jet reactivity as the flame heights scale with the heat loss from the jet. However, differences between flames with different fuels can still be seen in the absence of heat losses and these differences are magnified at higher Reynolds numbers. Particularly, methane flames are consistently taller and ethylene flames consistently shorter while other fuels present approximately the same flame height. \{LES\} reproduce the experimentally observed trends in global flame heights (effects of heat losses and Reynolds number) but some of the differences between fuels are not captured.},

  abstract = {Abstract Different non-intrusive optical and intrusive non optical diagnostic methods are used to measure flame and soot properties in a laminar coflow diffusion flame in order to compare and analyze the sensitivity of each technique to soot particles with different age and morphology. Flame temperature is measured using rapid thermocouple insertion (RTI) method and also by measuring soot spectral emissions (SSE). Soot volume fraction (fv) is measured quantitatively with laser extinction (LE), time resolved laser induced incandescent (TiRe-LII) and \{SSE\} methods and qualitatively from the transmission electron microscope (TEM) images of the thermophoretically sampled soot particles. Particle internal/aggregate nanostructure, and primary particle diameter are also analyzed based on \{TEM\} images from the sampled particles and TiRe-LII. It is shown that the optical methods are only sensitive to mature soot particles with solid appearance and cannot detect either temperature or fv in regions where liquid like nascent soot particles are dominant. fv measured by \{LE\} and TiRe-LII agree well while the values measured by \{SSE\} are lower. This discrepancy is attributed to the high sensitivity of fv measured by \{SSE\} to the measured temperature values. Temperature profiles measured by \{SSE\} are considerably higher than the values measured by RTI. It is shown that not considering the change of the surface emissivity of the thermocouple junction due to particle deposition for estimating radiation loss in regions where nascent or mature soot particles are dominant contributes to this discrepancy. Primary particle sizes measured based on \{TEM\} images and TiRe-LII agree reasonably well. Soot aggregate fractal dimension is shown to decrease as the soot particles age and become more mature. },

  abstract = {Abstract Given the recent \{EURO\} 6 regulations, which include limits on particle number density (and hence size) for soot emissions from land vehicles, soot models must be capable of accurately predicting soot particle sizes. Previous modeling work has demonstrated the importance of the relative strengths of nucleation and condensation in predicting soot primary particle size. Due to this importance, a fundamental reversible model for nucleation and condensation, called the reversible \{PAH\} clustering (RPC) model, was developed in previous work through the use of statistical mechanics and the results from several recent works. In the present work, the \{RPC\} model is enhanced to include multiple nucleation (or dimerization) events from 6 different \{PAH\} size groups, resulting in 21 unique dimer pairs. In addition, a soot \{PAH\} tracking model is developed to track the amount of each \{PAH\} size group within soot particles. The addition of this model resulted in reduced computation times and the ability to investigate PAH-PAH reactions within soot particles. The results of the enhanced \{RPC\} model demonstrate that smaller \{PAHs\} are most important for the nucleation process, while small and large \{PAHs\} are important for the condensation process. These results are shown to be due to the relatively lower reversibility of condensation versus the nucleation process. These findings are discussed in light of recent experimental results in the literature and are shown to be well supported. },

The chemico-physical properties of just-nucleated particles and particles at the early stage of growth are here investigated by X-ray and ultraviolet photoemission spectroscopy, UV–visible and Raman spectroscopy. Both classes of particles are produced and selectively analyzed by opportunely selecting both flame and sampling conditions. The complementarity of the methods and the consistency of the results allowed us to evidence the differences in the carbon structure of the two particles. Both kind of particles are predominantly composed by sp2 carbon and contain a few percent of oxygen mainly as ether-like bonds. A few percent of sp3 carbon has been observed in grown particles, and it coexists with a more developed graphitic structure with moderately larger aromatic islands, a lower band gap and higher density of states. The results of this work help to clarify the physicochemical transformation experienced by the just nucleated particles with sizes of 2–3 nm during the early steps of the growth process, which is fundamental for the improvement of current models of soot inception and growth. },

  abstract = {Abstract In this study, growth mechanisms of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) leading to soot formation were discussed. In addition, the effect of \{PAHs\} on soot nucleation was investigated by comparing the concentration of \{PAHs\} under sooting and non-sooting conditions. The feedstock ethylene was pyrolyzed in an isothermal laminar flow at 1150–1730 K with a residence time of 16–363 ms. Reaction pathways of \{PAH\} growth at each temperature were discussed using total ion chromatograms (TICs) of gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). These \{TICs\} suggest that the hydrogen-abstraction—carbon-addition (HACA) and methyl addition/cyclization (MAC) mechanisms are the main mechanisms for large \{PAHs\} at 1350 K and that phenyl addition/cyclization (PAC) also plays an important role at 1730 K. This paper was the identification of pathways previously rarely considered in soot models: the pathway via dimerization of acenaphthylene; the pathway from perylene to coronene; the pathway from tetraphene to benzo[k]tetraphene. Some significant peaks of aliphatic hydrocarbons were also detected in the \{TIC\} at 1730 K. The quantification of pyrolysates was examined by GC/MS with deuterides. At 1730 K, the number concentration of nascent soot increased along with the mole fraction of PAHs. Despite a relatively high mole fraction of \{PAHs\} with molecular masses of 200–300 u, no soot was observed at 1150 K. This indicates that such \{PAHs\} are not precursors of nascent soot. },

Soot was sampled directly from the flame using a sampling probe with a 0.5-mm diameter orifice and diluted with \{N2\} by a two-stage dilution process. The overall dilution ratio was not evaluated. An \{SMPS\} system was used to analyze soot particle concentrations in the diluted samples. Sampling conditions were optimized over a wide range of dilution ratios to eliminate the effect of agglomeration in the sampling probe. Two differential mobility analyzers (DMAs) with different size ranges were used separately in the \{SMPS\} measurements to characterize the entire size range of particles. In both flames, the \{PDFs\} were found to be mono-modal in nature near the jet exit. Further downstream, the profiles were flatter with a fall-off at larger particle diameters. The geometric mean of the soot size distributions was less than 10 nm for all cases and increased monotonically with axial distance in both flames. },

Three grids (64×64×16,192×192×48,320×320×80) are used in the simulations of DLR Flame A to examine the effect of the grid resolution. The numerical solutions of the resolved mixture fraction, the mixture fraction squared, and the density are duplicated in the LES code and the PDF code to explore the numerical consistency between them. A single laminar flamelet profile is used to reduce the computational cost of treating the chemical reactions of the particles. The sensitivity of the LES results to the time-step size is explored. Both first and second-order time splitting schemes are used for integrating the stochastic differential equations for the particles, and these are compared in the jet flame simulations. The numerical results are found to be sensitive to the grid resolution, and the 192×192×48 grid is adequate to capture the main flow fields of interest for this study. The numerical consistency between LES and PDF is confirmed by the small difference between their numerical predictions. Overall good agreement between the LES/PDF predictions and the experimental data is observed for the resolved flow fields and the composition fields, including for the mass fractions of the minor species and NO. The LES results are found to be insensitive to the time-step size for this particular flame.

  abstract = {Abstract It is known that the exhaust stream of internal combustion engines contains soot agglomerates with fractal geometries. The samples of real soot agglomerates can only be analyzed from projections observed with powerful microscopes. The fractal dimension of an agglomerate is estimated from the combination of its volume and a characteristic radius. The radius of gyration is often considered as the characteristic radius and, in case of being composed of uniform primary particles, the volume of the agglomerate can be represented by the number of primary particles. However, none of them (radius of gyration or number of primary particles) can be determined from projected images. As previous works have pointed out, there is an intrinsic error in the estimation of the real radius of gyration, which cannot be measured directly from the microscopy projected images. In this work, an algorithm is proposed to generate three-dimensional synthetic agglomerates that mimic the fractal geometry of real ones. The real three-dimensional radius of gyration is measured and compared to the one found from projections. Also, the number of primary particles is compared to that estimated from the projected area. The consequence of both estimation errors on the determination of the fractal dimension is analyzed. It is shown that the fractal dimension is overestimated when it is calculated from projected images. },

  abstract = {Abstract Molecular diffusion effects in LES of a piloted methane–air (Sandia D) flame are investigated on a series of grids with progressively increased resolution. The reacting density, temperature and chemical composition are modeled based on the mixture fraction approach combined with a steady flamelet model. With a rationale to minimize interpolation uncertainties that are routinely introduced by a flamelet table look-up, quadratic splines relationships are employed to represent thermochemical variables. The role of molecular diffusivity in effecting spatial transport is studied by drawing a comparison with the turbulent diffusivity and analyzing their statistics conditioned on temperature. Statistical results demonstrate that the molecular diffusivity in the near-field almost always exceeds the turbulent diffusivity, except at low temperatures (less than 500K). Thus, by altering the jet near-field, molecular transport plays an important role in the further downstream jet development. Molecular diffusivity continues to dominate in the centerline region throughout the flow field. Overall, the results suggest the strong necessity to represent molecular transport accurately in LES studies of turbulent reacting flows.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Recognizing the highly nonlinear and coupled nature of chemical reaction mechanisms of relevance to combustion, and that realistic combustion situations frequently involve extensive variations in the system pressure as well as the local temperature and composition, it is advocated that development of detailed and simplified reaction mechanisms should strive for comprehensiveness in their coverage in terms of thermodynamic parameters, combustion phenomena, and fuel hierarchy. The possibility of mechanism simplification without sacrificing comprehensiveness is demonstrated for a detailed ethylene oxidation mechanism that consists of 70 species and 463 elementary reactions. It is shown that this detailed mechanism can be first simplified, through application of the directed relation graph, to a skeletal mechanism that consists of only 33 species and 205 elementary reactions. This skeletal mechanism is then further simplified to a reduced mechanism that consists of only 21 species and 16 lumped reactions, obtained by assuming quasi-steadiness for species identified through computational singular perturbation. It is further demonstrated that these two mechanisms mimic closely and comprehensively the detailed mechanism for the homogeneous phenomena of perfectly stirred reactor and auto-ignition, and diffusive phenomena of the laminar flame speeds and counterflow ignition, over extensive variations in terms of the system pressure, temperature, and composition.},

  abstract = {Abstract Results obtained using a first-order conditional moment closure (CMC) approach to modeling turbulent, nonpremixed flames of methane are presented. Predictions are based on both k–ε and second-moment turbulence closures and use the GRI-Mech 2.11 kinetic scheme involving 279 reactions and 49 species and the GRI-Mech 3.0 scheme applying 325 reactions and 53 species. To provide a comprehensive assessment of the ability of these methods to predict a wide range of flames, comparisons are made with experimental data on three piloted and two unpiloted flames, the majority of which exhibit no local extinction effects. It is concluded that first-order CMC modeling is capable of yielding reliable predictions for flames with little or no extinction effect, with the only exception being NO, which is overpredicted at most locations and stoichiometries. Results derived using the two turbulence closures are in general in close accord, although real space predictions demonstrate the superiority of results derived on the basis of the second-moment turbulence closure. Calculation of flames that exhibit extinction effects demonstrate a gradual deterioration of results with increasing Re, pointing to the requirement for second-order CMC modeling as such effects become more significant. Anomalies are observed in regard to NO, which is significantly overpredicted for the piloted flames, but less so for the unpiloted flames. These results demonstrate a requirement not only to explore second-order CMC modeling approaches for such flames, but also to examine the application of different kinetic schemes, including a detailed investigation of the mechanisms and rates employed for NO chemistry.},

Planar measurements of temperature were performed using non-linear excitation regime two-line atomic fluorescence (nTLAF) of indium with an improved optical arrangement over those reported previously, and were found to yield good agreement with previous measurements obtained with coherent anti-Stokes Raman spectroscopy (CARS). Planar measurements of soot volume fraction and primary particle diameter were performed using time-resolved laser-induced incandescence (TiRe-LII). On the flame centreline, both the measured values of dp and fv grow with axial distance to peak near to the mid height of the flame. The joint probability density functions (PDF) of the measured T, fv, dp and derived Np were obtained from the two-dimensional images and assessed at 15 locations in the flame (5 radial × 3 axial locations). Strong correlations were found between fv, dp and Np, while they exhibit a moderate correlation with flame temperature. The changes in \{PDFs\} with radial and axial locations and the most probable values are also reported. },

A tandem differential mobility analyzer technique equipped with thermophoretic sampling was used to reveal the change in the mobility diameter of soot aggregates, which is proportional to the surface area. The mobility diameter decreased with an increase in reheating temperature. The decrease in mobility diameter clearly shows a decrease in the aggregate surface area. \{SEM\} images also clearly showed the decrease in the surface area and the simplification after heat treatment. These are experimental evidence that sintering of carbonaceous particle occurs in the absence of oxygen. Acetylene, which is considered to promote surface growth, is also added to size-selected soot particles before heat treatment to investigate the effect of surface growth on simplification of aggregate structure. The addition of acetylene, which is relevant to the surface growth via the hydrogen-abstraction/carbon-addition (HACA) mechanism, did not affect the mean mobility diameter at low temperature around 1200 K. These results showed that simplification of soot aggregates would not be affected by surface growth caused via the \{HACA\} mechanism. },

  abstract = {Abstract The evolution of soot in a turbulent nonpremixed bluff body ethylene/hydrogen (2:1 by volume) flame was investigated using a combination of experiments and Large Eddy Simulations and compared with a neat ethylene counterpart (Muelleret al., 2013). The maximum soot volume fraction in the recirculation zone and jet-like region of the ethylene/hydrogen case are significantly lower than that of the ethylene case. Flamelet calculations demonstrated that hydrogen addition suppressed soot formation due to the reduction of the C/H ratio, resulting in an estimated fourfold reduction in soot volume fraction due to chemical effects. Soot reduction in the downstream jet-like region of the flame is quantitatively consistent with this chemical effect. However, soot reduction in the recirculation zone is substantially larger than this analysis suggests, indicating an additional hydrodynamic effect. Large Eddy Simulation was used to further investigate soot evolution in the recirculation zone and to elucidate the role of hydrogen addition. For the same heat release rate and similar jet Reynolds number as the neat ethylene case, the addition of hydrogen requires a higher jet velocity, and this leads to a leaner recirculation zone that inhibits soot formation and promotes soot oxidation. },

First, a databank for temperature and species concentrations is developed from the solutions of counter-flow diffusion flames. The effects of flow field on flamelets are considered by using mixture fraction and scalar dissipation rate. Turbulence–chemistry interactions are taken into account by integrating different quantities based on a presumed probability density function (PDF), to calculate the Favre-averaged values of scalars. Flamelet library is then generated. To interpolate in the generated library, one artificial neural network (ANN) is trained where the mean and variance of mixture fraction and the scalar dissipation rate are used as inputs, and species mean mass fractions and temperature are selected as outputs. The weights and biases of this ANN are implemented in a CFD flow solver code, to estimate mean values of the scalars. Results reveal that ANN yields good predictions and the computational time has decreased as compared to numerical integration for the estimation of mean thermo-chemical variables in the CFD code. Predicted thermo-chemical quantities are close to those from experimental measurements but some discrepancies exist, which are mainly due to the assumption of non-unity Lewis number in the calculations.},

Previous applications of the method have been limited by the requirement that the equations governing the evolution of the lower-order moments be in closed form. Here a new approach, the quadrature method of moments (QMOM), is described. The dynamical equations for moment evolution are replaced by a quadrature-based approximate set that satisfies closure under a much broader range of conditions without requiring that the size distribution or growth law maintain any special mathematical form. The conventional MOM is recovered as a special case of the QMOM under those conditions, e.g., free-molecular growth, for which conventional closure is satisfied. The QMOM is illustrated for the growth of sulfuric acid-water aerosols and simulations of diffusion-controlled cloud droplet growth are presented.},

  abstract = {Abstract The understanding of soot formation in combustion processes and the optimization of practical combustion systems require in situ measurement techniques that can provide important characteristics, such as particle concentrations and sizes, under a variety of conditions. Of equal importance are techniques suitable for characterizing soot particles produced from incomplete combustion and emitted into the environment. Additionally, the production of engineered nanoparticles, such as carbon blacks, may benefit from techniques that allow for online monitoring of these processes. In this paper, we review the fundamentals and applications of laser-induced incandescence (LII) for particulate diagnostics in a variety of fields. The review takes into account two variants of LII, one that is based on pulsed-laser excitation and has been mainly used in combustion diagnostics and emissions measurements, and an alternate approach that relies on continuous-wave lasers and has become increasingly popular for measuring black carbon in environmental applications. We also review the state of the art in the determination of physical parameters central to the processes that contribute to the non-equilibrium nanoscale heat and mass balances of laser-heated particles; these parameters are important for LII-signal analysis and simulation. Awareness of the significance of particle aggregation and coatings has increased recently, and the effects of these characteristics on the \{LII\} technique are discussed. Because of the range of experimental constraints in the variety of applications for which laser-induced incandescence is suited, many implementation approaches have been developed. This review discusses considerations for selection of laser and detection characteristics to address application-specific needs. The benefits of using \{LII\} for measurements of a range of nanoparticles in the fields mentioned above are demonstrated with some typical examples, covering simple flames, internal-combustion engines, exhaust emissions, the ambient atmosphere, and nanoparticle production. We also remark on less well-known studies employing \{LII\} for particles suspended in liquids. An important aspect of the paper is to critically assess the improvement in the understanding of the fundamental physical mechanisms at the nanoscale and the determination of underlying parameters; we also identify further research needs in these contexts. Building on this enhanced capability in describing the underlying complex processes, \{LII\} has become a workhorse of particulate measurement in a variety of fields, and its utility continues to be expanding. When coupled with complementary methods, such as light scattering, probe-sampling, molecular-beam techniques, and other nanoparticle instrumentation, new directions for research and applications with \{LII\} continue to materialize. },

  abstract = {Abstract Turbulent fluctuations of the scalar dissipation rate have a major impact on extinction in non-premixed combustion. Recently, an unsteady extinction criterion has been developed (Hewson, 2013) that predicts extinction dependent on the duration and the magnitude of dissipation rate fluctuations exceeding a critical quenching value; this quantity is referred to as the dissipation impulse. The magnitude of the dissipation impulse corresponding to unsteady extinction is related to the difficulty with which a flamelet is exintguished, based on the steady-state S-curve. In this paper we evaluate this new extinction criterion for more realistic dissipation rates by evolving a stochastic Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process for the dissipation rate. A comparison between unsteady flamelet evolution using this dissipation rate and the extinction criterion exhibit good agreement. The rate of predicted extinction is examined over a range of Damköhler and Reynolds numbers and over a range of the extinction difficulty. The results suggest that the rate of extinction is proportional to the average dissipation rate and the area under the dissipation rate probability density function exceeding the steady-state quenching value. It is also inversely related to the actual probability that this steady-state quenching dissipation rate is observed and the difficulty of extinction associated with the distance between the upper and middle branches of the S-curve. },

Modeling soot formation and transport is challenging due to the complex chemical formation processes, and differential diffusion of soot relative to a flame. Direct numerical simulations (DNS) have highlighted the importance of such transport on soot concentrations, however DNS is computationally expensive. The one-dimensional turbulence (ODT) model is able resolve a full range of length and timescales and solves the evolution of diffusive and reactive scalars in the natural physical coordinate. We present results of soot formation in ODT and compare the model to simulation results from DNS in a temporally-evolving planar ethylene jet flame where the same transport, thermodynamic, and kinetic models are applied. Good agreement is found for the jet evolution in terms of the mixture fraction profiles. Conditional soot statistics (mean and fluctuations) are presented, along with joint soot-mixture fraction PDFs that illustrate the location and motion of soot in the mixture fraction coordinate. Good qualitative agreement between the models is found and the soot behavior is similar. While the ODT cannot capture three-dimensional flow structures, the ODT simulations are less computationally expensive than the DNS suggesting its use in conjunction with DNS for parametric study, model validation, and investigation at parameter ranges not currently available to DNS.},

Shelled and nonhollow microparticles were obtained from acetate and nitrate precursors, while nonhollow agglomerates were obtained from the oxalate suspension. At low furnace temperatures, the temperature and residence time of the particles were insufficient for complete decomposition of the precursors leading to Cu2o and Cu metal in the product. At 900 °C and above, reduced forms of CuO were not detected by x-ray measurements, and up to —60 wt. % YBCO was obtained. An approximate model predicting the particle and gas temperatures along the reactor under different operating conditions was developed. The model demonstrates that under the experimental conditions used here, the absorbed radiation heat by the particles from the furnace walls is significant in heating the gas. The gas and the particle temperatures are fairly close due to the effective heat transfer to the particles. At furnace temperatures of 700 °C, the maximum predicted particle temperature is about 500 °C (for s). —1 This explains the incomplete reactions obtained under these conditions. Above 900 °C the reactions are predicted to be complete within the first half of the furnace, leaving sufficient residence time for partial conversion into YBCO. Finally, an approximate expression predicting the relative contribution to the gas heating by the walls and the aerosol has been developed. © 1994, Materials Research Society. All rights reserved.},

Then, implicit-explicit, (N = 2), additive Runge-Kutta (ARK(sub 2)) methods from third- to fifth-order are presented that allow for integration of stiff terms by an L-stable, stiffly-accurate explicit, singly diagonally implicit Runge-Kutta (ESDIRK) method while the nonstiff terms are integrated with a traditional explicit Runge-Kutta method (ERK). Coupling error terms of the partitioned method are of equal order to those of the elemental methods. Derived ARK(sub 2) methods have vanishing stability functions for very large values of the stiff scaled eigenvalue, z['] yields -infinity, and retain high stability efficiency in the absence of stiffness, z['] yield 0. Extrapolation-type stage- value predictors are provided based on dense-output formulae. Optimized methods minimize both leading order ARK(sub 2) error terms and Butcher coefficient magnitudes as well as maximize conservation properties. Numerical tests of the new schemes on a CDR problem show negligible stiffness leakage and near classical order convergence rates. However, tests on three simple singular-perturbation problems reveal generally predictable order reduction. Error control is best managed with a PID-controller. While results for the fifth-order method are disappointing, both the new third- and fourth-order methods are at least as efficient as existing ARK.},

  abstract        = {Aerosol components and nanoparticles deriving from fuel combustion represent a class of exhaust emissions with critical relevance to environmental studies. In particular, the formation of nanoparticles is an important theme for environmental assessments of new fuel blends. Here, a set of computer simulations is carried out to study the behaviour of acetaldehyde-phenanthrene nanoparticles in relation to the influences to the three major atmospheric components CO2, O2, N2. The results show that phenanthrene and acetaldehyde quickly generate nanoparticles with dimensions of 2-5 nm in vacuum. The formed particles are stable in atmospheric conditions and interestingly absorb CO2 from the atmosphere-gas simulations but not O2 and N2. The probability of absorption of CO2 in the formed nanoparticles results as 10-20-fold compared to N2 and O2. Furthermore, acetaldehyde appears to localize on the surface of the formed nanoparticles, and seemingly acts with the planar geometry of phenanthrene as a facilitator for CO2 absorption. The results provided show also the properties of formed nanoparticle with higher concentrations of acetaldehyde and lower of phenanthrene, where phenanthrene forms the core of the nanoparticle, while acetaldehyde interacts with the surface and subsurface area in making their chemistry hydrophilic with a dense aromatic core. The study is important for further assessing bioethanol and fuel blends, and also introduces a methodology for studying interactions of gases and particles at the molecular level, with macroscopic significance. The study reports on growth of nanoparticles by CO2 absorption, introduces a new issue for blending fuels, with implications towards pollution profiles. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract      = {Aerosol emissions from coal combustion and waste incineration often have a bimodal mass distribution. The coarse mode consists mainly of entrained ash. The fine (submicron) mode may form by volatilization of a small fraction of mineral matter followed by reoxidation and recondensation. Fine mode particles may grow by coagulation into a size range near 0.1 μm, where they are stable over the process residence time. Alternatively, the fine mode may be scavenged by diffusion to the coarse mode. In this paper, we derive a simple analytical criterion for determining whether diffusion to the coarse mode will suppress growth of the fine mode. The analysis is based on two different analytical methods: (1) the self-preserving analysis, and (2) the monodisperse aerosol model and a (numerical) moment method. The half-life, t1 2, of the fine mode depends strongly on its initial mass concentration, m0, and on the first moment of the coarse mode size distribution, M1 c: t1 2 ∼ m0 4/M1 c5. There is a fairly sharp separation between the regime where a stable fine mode aerosol develops (t1 2 ≫ tresidence) and the regime of almost complete scavenging of the fine mode by the coarse mode (t1 2 ≪ tresidence). Through m0, the half-life depends on gas temperature and chemical composition in a complex way. © 1991.},

This article presents a study on the simulation of particle size distribution during nanoparticle growth with simultaneous chemical reaction, nucleation, condensation and coagulation. The method used to reduce the population balance model is the method of moments. Under the assumption of lognormal aerosol size distribution, the method of moments was employed to reduce the original model into a set of first-order ODE's (ordinary differential equations) that accurately reproduce important dynamics of aerosol process. The objective of this study is to investigate if we can use the reduced population balance model for the control of nanoparticle size distribution and to investigate the process model sensitivity to the influence of disturbance. And subsequently use the model to control particle size distribution. The numerical result shows there is a dependence of the average particle diameter on the wall temperatures and disturbance has great influence on process model. The process model was used as a basis to synthesize a feedback controller where manipulated variable is the wall temperature of the reactor and the control variable the aerosol size distribution at the outlet of the reactor.

  abstract      = {Allothermal cracking of methane is a suitable and eco-friendly way to simultaneously produce hydrogen and carbon black. The economic viability of the process relies on the ability to produce carbon black having well-defined characteristics, particularly concerning the particle size. A model for the study of the carbon particle size distribution during thermal cracking of methane has been developed. The model takes into account: heat transfer by conduction, convection, particle and gas radiation, homogenous and heterogenous reactions of methane dissociation, nucleation, and growth of solid carbon particle formed. The model alleges nanoparticles are in thermal equilibrium and do not impact the flow. A parametric study is made on operating pressure and temperature. As a result, the increase of the pressure and temperature increases the yield of thermal methane cracking. Moreover, results show a particle size distribution becoming narrower with increasing temperature and/or pressure. In these conditions, the particles population tends to be monodispersed. © 2016 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

Moment based methods have demonstrated advantages such as reduced computational effort especially for applications that couple population balance (PB) simulation with computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The methods, however, suffers from two main drawbacks: the inability to yield the number density directly and limitation to system models that only consider size independent growth expression and certain breakage and aggregation kernels. This article presents an extension to the standard MOM (SMOM), the extended method of moment (EMOM), which not only allows the prediction of the number density directly in most cases, but also makes it applicable to systems with size dependent growth and any particle aggregation and breakage kernels. The method is illustrated and tested by reference to case studies that were well studied systems in the literature. © 2013.},

In particular, it describes the role of small-scale diffusive processes on that transport, and it has been modeled using an eddy-diffusivity approximation. The results suggest that the eddy-diffusivity approximation works well over a wide range of conditions for soot, but that the approximation, in the present form, breaks down for species for which the flame chemistry is fast, such as those participating in the main-flame chemistry. This breakdown is analyzed in a way that suggests a correction to the eddy-diffusivity model for fast chemistry, but this correction has not been carried out at this point.},

During this period an Asian dust event has been observed from 10 to 13 and 24-26 April in the Korean peninsula. The estimated anthropogenic aerosols excluding the Asian dust are implemented to estimate radiative forcing at the surface, at the top of atmosphere (TOA) and atmospheric aerosol absorption in East Asia using the National Center for Atmospheric Research column radiation model of the community climate model. The results indicate that the area averaged column integrated anthropogenic aerosol concentration in East Asia is estimated to be about 20 mg m-2, of which 46%, 29%, 20%, 4% and 1% are contributed by mixed type, inorganic (IOC), sea salt, organic carbon and black carbon aerosol, respectively. The daytime area mean direct shortwave radiative forcing at the surface is found to be about -5.9 W m-2, of which IOC and the mixed type aerosol contribute about 95% whereas that at TOA is about -4.1 W m-2, of which the IOC and the mixed type aerosol contribute more than 90%. Consequently the area mean atmospheric absorption due to anthropogenic aerosol layer in East Asia is about 1.8 W m-2. The result clearly confirms the existence of a cooling effect (negative forcing) due to the direct effect of anthropogenic aerosols at the surface and TOA in East Asia. However, the atmosphere of the troposphere above the ground is slightly heated due to absorbing aerosol layers that are composed of black carbon and the mixed type aerosol. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

The analysis is reduced to a problem of solving a nonlinear second-order ordinary differential equation of energy for various combinations of the gas-phase Damköhler number and the surface Damköhler number. The surface reaction is found to have chemically the same effect as the increase of the stoichiometric ratio of gas-phase reaction and gasdynamically the increase of the fuel injection rate, so that the combustion rate of solid carbon is generally expected to be small.

A detailed chemical mechanism, which includes polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and a high-order method of moments for soot modeling are employed for the first time in a three-dimensional simulation of turbulent sooting flame. It is shown that soot nucleates and grows mainly in the region between 0.3 and 0.5 in mixture fraction space, and it is spread out in the whole mixture fraction space owing to differential diffusion effects. From the analysis of Lagrangian trajectories, it appears that the presence of soot at large values of mixture fraction is related to turbulent fluctuations whose overall effects cannot be captured considering only the average mixing process. Soot moving toward the flame is oxidized, therefore soot mass is negligible for a mixture fraction smaller than 0.25. Finally, it is observed that decreasing by a factor of two the Damk¨ohler number has negligible effects on the overall soot number density while it causes a decrease of a factor of four in the soot volume fraction.},

The Petrov-Galerkin Chebyshev spectral method was presented in detail focusing on the analyticity of solenoidal vector field used for the approximation of the flow. It satisfies the pole condition exactly at the origin, and can be used to expand the vector functions efficiently by using the solenoidal condition. This developed TEMOM method has no prior requirement for the particle size distribution (PSD). It is much simpler than the method of moment (MOM) and quadrature method of moments (QMOM), and is a promising method to approximate the aerosol general dynamics equation (GDE). The coupled fluid and particle fields were presented with three non-dimensional parameters (i.e., Reynolds number, Re; Schmidt number based on particle moment, ScM, and Damkohler number, Da in the governing equations). The temporal evolutions of the first three moments were discussed for different Damkohler numbers. The particle volume increases at all locations in the flow field, the larger the Damkohler number, the greater generation rate of large-scale particles. Far away from the eddy structure, the effect of the fluid convection on particle coagulation is small; however, the particle coagulation within the eddy core has an obvious wave-like distribution because of the large-scale eddy. The results reveal that the coherent structures play a significant role in the particle coagulation inside an exhaust pipe. Copyright © 2009 Tech Science Press.},

  abstract = {An experimental investigation has been conducted on the influence of pressure on soot formation in counterflow diffusion flames of nitrogen-diluted ethylene versus air from 1 to 2.5 atm. By measuring the sooting strain rate limits in counterflow flames while maintaining the same flame temperature through argon substitution, the influence of pressure on soot inception/growth is isolated. Results demonstrate that the sooting tendency is enhanced at elevated pressures, with its magnitude being of the same order as that of the fuel dilution effect. The density-weighted strain rate at the sooting limit is found to vary linearly with pressure, and hence suggesting that the overall soot inception/growth reaction is of first order within the pressure range studied. Through numerical simulation of the detailed flame structure, the characteristic dependence of the sooting limit on pressure and fuel concentration is found to be consistent with mass growth processes dominated by the acetylene reactions.},

Here, a photon Monte Carlo method for the solution of the radiative transfer equation has been integrated into a turbulent combustion direct numerical simulation (DNS) code. \{DNS\} has been used to investigate \{TRI\} in a canonical configuration with systematic variations in optical thickness. The formulation allows for nongray gas properties, scattering, and general boundary treatments, although in this study, attention has been limited to gray radiation properties, no scattering, and black boundaries. Individual contributions to emission and absorption \{TRI\} have been isolated and quantified. Of particular interest are intermediate values of optical thickness where, for example, the smallest hydrodynamic and chemical scales are optically thin while the largest turbulence scales approach an optically thick behavior. In the configuration investigated, the temperature self-correlation contribution (emission) is primarily a function of the ratio of burned-gas temperature to unburned-gas temperature, and is the dominant contribution to \{TRI\} only in the optically thin limit. Even in the most optically thin case considered, the absorption coefficient–Planck function correlation and absorption coefficient–intensity correlation are not negligible. At intermediate values of optical thickness, contributions from all three correlations are significant. },

An alternative and promising method to improve the bioavailability of pharmaceutical agents is the production of nanoscale particles by the rapid expansion of supercritical solutions (RESS). Our research is aimed towards an improved understanding of the underlying physical phenomena of the relationship between the process conditions and the particle characteristics. Therefore, experimental investigations and numerical simulations were performed. RESS experiments with the pharmaceutical substances β-sitosterol, griseofulvin, and ibuprofen led to particle sizes in the range of 240±80 nm. In addition, as one step towards intravenous application of poorly soluble drugs, β-sitosterol was used to produce aqueous suspensions of a water-insoluble drug with a particle size smaller than or equal to those produced by RESS into air. RESS modeling is focused on the flow through the nozzle, the supersonic free jet, the mach shock, and particle growth in the expansion unit. The comparison with experimental results shows a good agreement in the general trends but does not match exactly the measured mean particle sizes.},

Schemes with various temporal accuracies and arbitrary spatial accuracy for both inviscid and viscous terms are presented and analyzed. All integration schemes use explicit or compact finite-difference derivative operators. Three classes of schemes are considered: an extension of MacCormack's original second-order temporally accurate method, a new third-order variant of the schemes proposed by Rusanov and by Kutier, Lomax, and Warming (RKLW), and third- and fourth-order Runge-Kutta schemes. In each scheme, stability and formal accuracy are considered for the interior operators on the convection-diffusion equation U(sub t) + aU(sub x) = alpha U(sub xx). Accuracy is also verified on the nonlinear problem, U(sub t) + F(sub x) = 0. Numerical treatments of various orders of accuracy are chosen and evaluated for asymptotic stability. Formally accurate boundary conditions are derived for several sixth- and eighth-order central-difference schemes. Damping of high wave-number data is accomplished with explicit filters of arbitrary order. Several schemes are used to compute variable-density compressible shear layers, where regions of large gradients exist.},

  abstract = {An unsteady flamelet model, which will be called the Lagrangian Flamelet Model, has been applied to a steady, turbulent CH4/H2/N2–air diffusion flame. The results have been shown to be in reasonable agreement with experimental data for axial velocity, mixture fraction, species mass fractions, and temperature. The application of three different chemical mechanisms leads to the promising conclusion that the state-of-the-art mechanisms yield almost identical results. To explain the still remaining differences from the experimental data, the effects of differential diffusion are discussed. Three possible mechanisms leading to differential diffusion are proposed: Firstly, the occurrence of a laminar mixing layer in a region very close to the nozzle exit; secondly, the molecular diffusivity being of the same order of magnitude as the turbulent eddy diffusivity; thirdly, a typical length scale of the mixing layer thickness being smaller than the small turbulent eddies leading to a laminar sublayer. By investigating the computational results for the considered configuration, the first mechanism has been concluded to be the only possibility. Further calculations have been performed, which account for differential diffusion by assuming the flow to be laminar very close to the nozzle and switching to unity Lewis numbers downstream of the potential core. The results lead to a significant improvement of the agreement to experimental data. It can be shown from the computational results and the experimental data that the differential diffusion effects arise from this laminar region. However, even though the Lewis numbers are assumed to be unity throughout the remaining part of the flow field these differential diffusion effects remain to a certain extent, even in the far downstream region, affecting for instance the centerline temperature by approximately 100 K. This demonstrates that differential diffusion can cause a strong history effect in turbulent jet diffusion flames.},

  abstract  = {An updated reduced gas-phase kinetic mechanism was developed and integrated with aerosol models to predict soot formation characteristics in ethylene nonpremixed and premixed flames. A primary objective is to investigate the sensitivity of the soot formation to various chemical pathways for large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). The gas-phase chemical mechanism adopted the KAUST-Aramco PAH Mech 1.0, which utilized the AramcoMech 1.3 for gas-phase reactions validated for up to C2 fuels. In addition, PAH species up to coronene (C24H12 or A7) were included to describe the detailed formation pathways of soot precursors. In this study, the detailed chemical mechanism was reduced from 397 to 99 species using directed relation graph with expert knowledge (DRG-X) and sensitivity analysis. The method of moments with interpolative closure (MOMIC) was employed for the soot aerosol model. Counterflow nonpremixed flames at low strain rate sooting conditions were considered, for which the sensitivity of soot formation characteristics to different nucleation pathways were investigated. Premixed flame experiment data at different equivalence ratios were also used for validation. The findings show that higher PAH concentrations result in a higher soot nucleation rate, and that the total soot volume and average size of the particles are predicted in good agreement with experimental results. Subsequently, the effects of different pathways, with respect to pyrene- or coronene-based nucleation models, on the net soot formation rate were analyzed. It was found that the nucleation processes (i.e., soot inception) are sensitive to the choice of PAH precursors, and consideration of higher PAH species beyond pyrene is critical for accurate prediction of the overall soot formation.},

  abstract  = {Approximate methods for estimating the optical properties of flame-generated soot aggregates were evaluated using existing computer simulations and measurements in the visible and near-infrared portions of the spectrum. The following approximate methods were evaluated for both individual aggregates and polydisperse aggregate populations: the Rayleigh scattering approximation, Mie scattering for an equivalent sphere, and Rayleigh-Debye-Gans (R-D-G) scattering for both given and fractal aggregates. Results of computer simulations involved both prescribed aggregate geometry and numerically generated aggregates by cluster-cluster aggregation; multiple scattering was considered exactly, considered using the mean-field approximation, and ignored using the R-D-G approximation. Measurements involved the angular scattering properties of soot in the postflame regions of both premixed and nonpremixed flames. The results show that available computer simulations and measurements of soot aggregate optical properties are not adequate to provide a definitive evaluation of the approximate prediction methods. The simulations involve either exact solutions for small aggregates where effects of multiple scattering are small, or approximate solutions of uncertain accuracy for the large aggregates of interest for practical flames. The measurements are limited to conditions where soot aggregate structure is not known, and for relatively large scattering angles where the various approximations yield similar results. Within these limitations (for aggregates larger than the Rayleigh scattering regime) the approximate theories performed as follows: Rayleigh scattering generally understimated scattering, Mie scattering for an equivalent sphere yielded unreliable results, while basic and fractal aggregate R-D-G scattering yielded best results for given and fractal aggregates, respectively. However, existing simulations suggest significant effects of multiple scattering for soot aggregates (except near soot inception conditions) that are not included in R-D-G scattering so that improved approximate optical theories for soot aggregates should be sought.},

Moment Dynamics Equations (MDEs) of the Modal Aerosol Dynamics (MAD) approach were extended to simulate the Brownian coagulation process of multimodal aerosols covering full size ranges and arbitrary fractal dimensions for implementation in three-dimensional atmospheric aerosol chemical transport and climate models. The proposed approach is referred as the Modal Aerosol Dyanmics 'model' for multiple Modes and fractal Shapes (MADMS). The approximation of Otto, Fissan, Park, and Lee (1997) for intramodal coagulation in the free-molecular regime was for the first time extended to intermodal coagulation with different geometric standard deviations and geometric mean diameters (Dg) for arbitrary mass fractal dimensions (Df). To evaluate the accuracy of the MADMS model and to examine temporal evolution of coagulating aerosol modes under atmospheric conditions, simple one-box simulations using the model were performed and compared with rigorous numerical solutions obtained using the difference (bin) method. Deviations of MADMS from the accurate bin method (BIN100, dlogD=3.01×10-2, 100 bins between 1nm and 1γm and 100 between 1γm and 1mm) are smaller than 5% in number and volume concentrations and smaller than 2% in and Dg during the period for 30% of the initial number concentration to coagulate (t30). The MADMS model is four to six orders of magnitude faster than BIN100 with respect to CPU time. It was found to be sometimes comparable in accuracy to, but generally one order of magnitude more accurate than, the bin method with a coarse bin-grid resolution (BIN10, dlogD=3.01×10-1, 10 bins between 1nm and 1γm), which is commonly used for 3-D simulations, as well as two to four orders of magnitude faster than BIN10. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

Especially very small, below ten nanometer-sized, particles in the early stages of the soot nucleation process are interesting targets for more detailed inspection, to reveal useful insight and to guide further model development. In this study, Helium-ion microscopy (HIM) is applied as an imaging technique new to combustion studies to analyze the morphology of soot particles >2 nm and to determine their geometrical characteristics. For this analysis, a series of premixed ethylene flames are investigated. Mobility size measurements from an earlier investigation have been compared with the particle sizes determined by HIM. Observed particle shapes and geometrical statistics suggest that in all flames under investigation, nascent soot possesses no well-defined morphologies. Additionally, investigations have been made using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) to obtain more information on the chemical characteristics of these particles. © 2014 The Combustion Institute.

The underlying mechanisms due to Brownian motion are employed in the general dynamic equation which is further closed by Taylor-expansion technique. The newly proposed model provides high precision and efficiency in studying the present binary nucleation system as compared to exiting models. The competition between nucleation, coagulation and condensation in the whole nucleation and subsequent growth processes is systemically investigated in both cases with background particles and without particles. The results show the nucleation kinetics and aerosol dynamics are strongly dependent of production rate of sulfuric acid, and also dependent of the competition ability to scavenge sulfuric acid between pre-existing particles and nucleated particles. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract        = {Brownian coagulation is the most important inter-particle mechanism affecting the size distribution of aerosols. Analytical solutions to the governing population balance equation (PBE) remain a challenging issue. In this work, we develop an analytical model to solve the PBE under Brownian coagulation based on the Taylor-expansion method of moments. The proposed model has a clear advantage over conventional asymptotic models in both precision and efficiency. We first analyze the geometric standard deviation (GSD) of aerosol size distribution. The new model is then implemented to determine two analytic solutions, one with a varying GSD and the other with a constant GSD. The varying solution traces the evolution of the size distribution, whereas the constant case admits a decoupled solution for the zero and second moments. Both solutions are confirmed to have the same precision as the highly reliable numerical model, implemented by the fourth-order Runge-Kutta algorithm, and the analytic model requires significantly less computational time than the numerical approach. Our results suggest that the proposed model has great potential to replace the existing numerical model, and is thus recommended for the study of physical aerosol characteristics, especially for rapid predictions of haze formation and evolution. © 2014 Chinese Society of Particuology and Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

In the eastern US, PM2.5 concentrations have relatively small IAVs with no explicit seasonality, with the absolute percent departure from the mean (APDM) values of 4-16% in four seasons. The IAVs of PM2.5 are found to be large in North China and the northwestern Europe during winter and spring.

Additionally, we obtain the key meteorological parameters that drive the IAVs of PM2.5 by the stepwise multiline regression model (SLR) containing 8 meteorological variables.

The results are found to be in a form that corrects Smoluchowski's solution for both polydispersity and size-dependent kernel.

  abstract      = {Classical aerosol schemes use either a sectional (bin) or lognormal approach. Both approaches have particular capabilities and interests: the sectional approach is able to describe every kind of distribution, whereas the lognormal one makes assumption of the distribution form with a fewer number of explicit variables. For this last reason we developed a three-moment lognormal aerosol scheme named ORILAM to be coupled in three-dimensional mesoscale or CTM models. This paper presents the concept and hypothesis of a range of aerosol processes such as nucleation, coagulation, condensation, sedimentation, and dry deposition. One particular interest of ORILAM is to keep explicit the aerosol composition and distribution (mass of each constituent, mean radius, and standard deviation of the distribution are explicit) using the prediction of three-moment (m0, m3, and m6). The new model was evaluated by comparing simulations to measurements from the Escompte campaign and to a previously published aerosol model. The numerical cost of the lognormal mode is lower than two bins of the sectional one. Copyright 2005 by the American Geophysical Union.},

The particle field is obtained by employing a moment method to approximate the nanoparticle general dynamic equation. An incompressible fluid containing particles of 1 nm in diameter is projected into a particle-free ambient. The results show that the coherent structures dominate the evolution of the nanoparticle number intensity, diameter and polydispersity distributions as the jet develops. In addition, the coherent structures act to increase the diffusion of particles, and the vortex rolling-up makes the particles distributing more irregularly while the vortex pairing causes particle distributions to become uniform. As the jet travels downstream, the time-averaged particle number concentration becomes lower in the jet core and higher in the outskirts, whereas the time-averaged particle mass over the entire flow field maintains unaltered, and the time-averaged particle diameter and geometric standard deviations grow and reach their maximum on the interface of the jet region and the ambient.},

Volatiles released from the coal particles formed a cloud of soot particles at high temperatures in the absence of oxygen. The soot particles in the cloud were collected at different residence times using a water-cooled, nitrogen-quenched suction probe. Test variables included the reaction temperature and coal type. Soot yields in terms of weight percentage of dry ash-free coal were measured based on bulk soot collection experiments. The measured soot yields were related to coal rank, reaction temperature, and residence time. Size changes of soot particles due to soot agglomeration were also observed. The information obtained about coal-derived soot is useful in predictions of radiative heat transfer and pollutant formations in the near-burner region of pulverized coal-fired furnaces.},

Much of this behavior can be described in terms of the invariance of the aggregates under changes of spatial length scale: they appear to be fractals. There are two types of basic mechanisms for producing fractal aggregates. Those in which aggregation proceeds cluster by cluster can be understood qualitatively in terms of a solvable schematic model. The diffusion-limited aggregation or deposition of individual particles to make a large cluster is not as well understood. It is closely related to several irreversible processes in other areas of physics, such as two-fluid displacement in porous materials and the dielectric breakdown of insulators. More generally, disorderly growth mechanisms provide structures having unique properties, many of which can be understood by using simple statistical principles.},

  abstract   = {Combustion is central to society and accounts for the majority of the world’s energy production. Soot formation, transport, and emission from turbulent flames are an impor- tant process in nonpremixed combustion. Soot is a major air pollutant with adverse health effects; its emission reduces combustion efficiencies associated with unburned fuel; and soot interacts strongly with the composition and temperature fields of flames, contributing to the bulk of radiative heat transfer. Simulation of combustion is an important and emerging discipline that compliments theoretical and experimental investigations and can provide fundamental insight into turbulent combustion environments and aid in engi- neering design of practical equipment. Simulations of practical combustion environments cannot fully resolve all flow and chemical phenomena due to the wide range of timescales and lengthscales present and must rely on models to capture the effects of unresolved turbulent transport and turbulence-chemistry interactions.

Very little is know about soot formation in turbulent flames due to the difficulty of experimental measurements and the computational cost of simulation. Direct numerical simulation (DNS) resolves all relevant flow and chemical structures in turbulent flames, requiring no turbulence closure models. DNS of soot formation with realistic combustion chemistry and soot formation is presented in this dissertation. A series of increasingly complex flow configurations is investigated including one-dimensional relaxing diffusion flames, two-dimensional mixing layers and decaying turbulence simulations, and a three- dimensional temporally evolving jet flame. A reduced ethylene mechanism consisting of 19 transported species is coupled to a four-step soot model using the method of moments.

The DNS are used to quantify soot formation and transport in turbulent flames. The proximity of soot to a flame is important, as this impacts the soot reaction and radiation rates. Differential diffusion between soot and the mixture fraction is very important. Multidimensional flame dynamic effects including flame curvature are shown to influence the direction of soot transport relative to a flame. The DNS provide a database by which turbulent combustion models may be validated and developed. Soot formation in the laminar flamelet and conditional moment closure models is examined.},

  year          = {2006},
  volume        = {2006},
  abstract      = {Condensing flows can be found in a large variety of industrial machinery such as steam turbines and supersonic gas conditioners. In many of these applications, it is very important to predict the droplet size distributions accurately. In the present research, the droplet size distribution in condensing flows is investigated numerically. We consider condensing flows with droplets that nucleate and grow, but do not slip with respect to the surrounding gas phase. To compute the coupling between the condensed phase and the carrier flow, one could solve the general dynamic equation and the fluid dynamics equations simultaneously. In order to reduce the overall computational effort of this procedure by roughly an order of magnitude, we use an alternative procedure, in which the general dynamic equation is initially replaced by moment equations complemented with a closure assumption. This closure assumption is based on Hill's approximation of the droplet growth law. The method thus obtained, the so-called Method of Moments, is assumed to approximately accommodate the thermodynamic effects of condensation, such as the temperature, pressure and velocity field of the carrier flow. We use the Method of Moments as a basis for the calculation of the droplet size distribution function. We propose to solve the general dynamic equation a posteriori along a number of selected fluid trajectories, keeping the flow field fixed. This procedure, called Phase Path Analysis [1], leads to accurate size distribution esti mates, at afar lower computational cost than solving the general dynamic equation and the fluid dynamics equations simultaneously. In the present paper, we investigate the effect of a variation in the liquid mass density on the droplet size distribution, using the proposed method. In case of a varying liquid mass density, both the equation for the dropltet growth rate and the moment equations are modified. This modified form coincides with the usual form of the moment equations in the event that the variation in liquid density is negligible. This research is relevant for condensation in flows where large temperature differences may occur which lead to significant variations in the liquid mass density. We show that the implementation of a variable liquid mass density in the Method of Moments and the Phase Path Analysis results in a higher extremum in the droplet size distribution, whereas the skewed shape of the distribution function is nearly similar to that obtained in the constant liquid density case.

  abstract      = {Controlling the emission of submicron particles of toxic metals in a combustion system poses a challenge. One possible mechanism for removing these fine particles is through intercoagulation with coarse particles. A bimodal lognormal model was applied to investigate the impact of intercoagulation rate on the size distributions of fine-mode aerosols. Fine-mode particle removal time was found to depend strongly on the number concentration of coarse-mode particles, but it was independent on the number concentration of fine-mode particles. An increase of geometric standard deviation of fine-mode particles from 1 to 1.6 significantly increased the dimensionless removal time 27 times. On the contrary, an increase of the deviation of coarse-mode particles in the same range only decreased 3% of the dimensionless removal time. The variation of geometric mean size ratio, meanwhile, had only insignificant effects on dimensionless removal time. For a constant mass concentration, removal time decreased as geometric standard deviation narrowed and mean size of coarse mode decreased. Fine-mode particles ultimately approached monodisperse when the dominant mechanism was intercoagulation; meanwhile, coarse-mode particles approached the asymptotic shape because intracoagulation was the dominant mechanism. The results show that on a constant mass basis, monodisperse coarse-mode particles with a high number concentration are the optimal condition for enhanced removal of fine-mode particles through intercoagulation.},

The model accounts for the main physical phenomena involved, i.e. hydrodynamics, mass transfer, phase equilibrium, crystallization kinetics. Simulations are performed in 3D with a special insight in turbulence modeling. Numerical results are compared with experimental data from literature. Although experimental and simulated PSD fit satisfactorily, results emphasize the major role of the crystal-fluid interfacial tension on the accuracy.

Brownian diffusion, thermophoresis, and coagulation of the particles were considered and effects of these phenomena on particle deposition were studied. A moment model was developed in order to predict distributions of particle number density and particle size simultaneously. Particle deposition with various wedge configurations was examined for conditions selected for a typical VAD process. When coagulation was considered, the geometric mean particle size and its geometric standard deviation increased and the particle number density decreased, compared to the case without coagulation. These results proved the fact that coagulation effect expands particle size distribution. The results were discussed with characteristics of thermal and diffusion boundary layers. As the boundary layers grew in thickness, overall temperature and concentration gradient decreased, resulting in decrease of deposition rate and increase of particle residence time in the flow and thus coagulation effect. Effect of wedge configuration on particle deposition efficiency was studied and discussed also with the characteristics of boundary layers.

The employed kinetic model of soot formation, developed and tested earlier for subatmospheric and atmospheric flames, can quantitatively describe the experimental soot volume fraction profiles collected in a number of ehtylene flames at high pressures. The kinetic model consists of initial aromatic ring formation from nonaromatic species, planar polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) growth through the hydrogen-abstraction-acetylene-addition reaction mechanism, particle nucleation through coalescence of PAHs, particle growth by coagulation and surface reactions of the forming clusters and particles, and particle oxidation. Analysis of the computational results obtained at 10 bar and additional tests performed for a 1-bar flame suggest that the influence of pressure on soot production arises mainly from the larger concentration of acetylene, which affects both the soot surface growth and the nucleation of soot particles.},

In this study, the primary particle size and nanostructure were investigated at five engine operating conditions for a medium-duty direct injection diesel engine, using a high-resolution transmission electron microscope (TEM). The diesel particles were collected from diluted exhaust gas and an ultrasonic extraction method was used for obtaining the TEM samples. The TEM images reveal that primary particle size and nanostructure depend on the engine operating conditions. The mean diameter of the primary particles is in the range 23.8-28.5. nm, depending on the engine speed and engine load. The nanostructure could reflect the particle formation processes. The larger primary particles are formed at low engine speed and high engine load. They have irregular shape and distinguishable trace of pre-formed particle, indicating the combined effect of particle coalescence and surface growth. Primary particles with core-shell structure are common at high engine load with different engine speeds. The particles exhibit disorder structure at low engine load and high engine speed due to lower in-cylinder gas temperature and shorter combustion duration. Quantitative analysis of the nanostructures indicates that graphitization of primary particles is affected by engine load but not by engine speed. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract = {Dilute gas–particle flows can be described by a kinetic equation containing terms for spatial transport, gravity, fluid drag and particle–particle collisions. However, direct numerical solution of kinetic equations is often infeasible because of the large number of independent variables. An alternative is to reformulate the problem in terms of the moments of the velocity distribution. Recently, a quadrature-based moment method was derived for approximating solutions to kinetic equations. The success of the new method is based on a moment-inversion algorithm that is used to calculate non-negative weights and abscissas from the moments. The moment-inversion algorithm does not work if the moments are non-realizable, which might lead to negative weights. It has been recently shown [14] that realizability is guaranteed only with the 1st-order finite-volume scheme that has an inherent problem of excessive numerical diffusion. The use of high-order finite-volume schemes may lead to non-realizable moments. In the present work, realizability of the finite-volume schemes in both space and time is discussed for the 1st time. A generalized idea for developing realizable high-order finite-volume schemes for quadrature-based moment methods is presented. These finite-volume schemes give remarkable improvement in the solutions for a certain class of problems. It is also shown that the standard Runge–Kutta time-integration schemes do not guarantee realizability. However, realizability can be guaranteed if strong stability-preserving (SSP) Runge–Kutta schemes are used. Numerical results are presented on both Cartesian and triangular meshes.},

A 15-step, 19-species (with 10 quasi-steady species) chemical mechanism was used for gas chemistry, with a two-moment, four-step, semiempirical soot model. Flame curvature is shown to result in flames that move, relative to the fluid, either toward or away from rich soot formation regions, resulting in soot being essentially convected into or away from the flame. This relative motion of flame and soot results in a wide spread of soot in the mixture fraction coordinate. In regions where the center of curvature of the flame is in the fuel stream, the flame motion is toward the fuel and soot is located near the flame at high temperature and hence has higher reaction rates and radiative heat fluxes. Soot–flame breakthrough is also observed in these regions. Fluid convection and flame displacement velocity relative to fluid convection are of similar magnitudes while thermophoretic diffusion is 5–10 times lower. These results emphasize the importance of both unsteady and multidimensional effects on soot formation and transport in turbulent flames.},

A detailed kinetic mechanism including 12 reactive species and 27 elementary reactions is used to represent the H2/air reaction in turbulence. Although the flame condition is classified into the well-stirred reactor regime, the geometry of the regions with high heat release rate shows thin sheetlike structure. The fluctuation of the heat release rate along the flame surface is relatively high, and the maximum heat release rate reaches up to 1,3 times the corresponding laminar flame. The heat release rate tends to be high in the regions convex toward the burned side. The flame structure in the case of the well-stirred reactor regime shows a double-layered feature. One may conclude that reaction zone becomes thick in the well-stirred reactor regimes only from temperature, H, and OH distributions, while the heat release rate, mass fraction of O atoms, and reaction rates of O atoms and OH radicals are fluctuating significantly in that region in fact. Specifically, reaction rates of O atoms and OH radicals show characteristic behaviors in the burned side due to their chemical characteristics. In the preheat zone, mass fraction and reaction rate of HO2 show quite thin and smooth distributions compared to other properties such as the heat release rate. The distribution of H2O2 reaction rate reflects the double-layered feature of the well-stirred reactor regime very well. It is shown that the double-layered feature can be explained by discussing the balances of the elementary reactions in detail. As the flame front can be defined even in the well-stirred reactor regime, statistics of the local flame elements are also discussed.},

Combust. Inst. 31 (2007) 1633-1640). In the present paper, the data are analyzed to understand the processes of extinction and reignition observed in the simulations. A measure of extinction based on the amount of stoichiometric surface area having a reacting scalar less than a threshold value is used to characterize extinction. Employing this characterization leads naturally to the appearance of a local displacement speed of “flame edges” as the primary quantity of interest. Flame edges are defined as the boundaries on the stoichiometric surface between areas having a reacting scalar less than the threshold (extinguished) and those above it (burning). The displacement speed is the speed at which these boundaries move relative to the local flow. The motion of flames edges is studied using a massively parallel analysis tool. The joint probability density function of the local edge flame speed and scalar dissipation rate has been extracted and reveals a transition in character as the simulation progresses. The transition is interpreted in the context of the physical mechanisms of extinction and reignition. Along with evidence of the alignment of the scalar and mixture fraction normal vectors, it indicates that the mechanism of folding by turbulence of burning regions onto extinguished ones is the dominant reignition mechanism for the simulated conditions.},

  abstract        = {Drum granulation processes are represented by a set of mass transfer, solid transport, as well as population balance equations. The population balance is mathematically described by partial differential-integral equations. The overall granulation model is highly non-linear, large-scale with multiple coordinates and uncertain parameters, leading to tremendous difficulties for optimisation and control. In our previous work, a two-level control strategy is proposed, which consists of an upper level optimal control for the determination of optimal set-points, and a lower level non-linear model predictive control (NMPC) for the simultaneous computations of uncertain parameters and control variables. However, long computing times and insufficient measurement data prevent industrial applications. In this paper, strategies are developed to improve the applicability of the multi-level, model predictive control scheme (ML-MPC) using the multi-form modelling approach. In the multi-form modelling approach, the granulation plants are represented by a variety of model forms for different end-uses. These include: (1) the distributed parameter population balance model (DP-PBM), (2) the lumped parameter population balance model (LP-PBM), (3) matrix representation with off-line computed matrix elements, (4) local linear models, (5) reduced order models using balanced truncating and methods of moment. It can be shown through dynamic simulations that significant computing time reductions can be achieved with properly selected model forms. Since both open-loop optimal control and closed loop MPC rely on iterative dynamic optimisation, overall computing time reduction makes on-line applications possible. Furthermore, the development of local linear models allows the applications of well-established linear system theory and techniques to process control, parameter identification and model order reduction. The demonstrated advantages of the proposed multi-form modelling approach imply a big step forward towards the industrial applications of model-based control for granulation processes. © 2006 Elsevier B.V.

  abstract = {EPA has completed the process of updating and revising, where appropriate, its Air Quality Criteria for Particulate Matter (PM) as issued in 1996 (usually referred to as the Criteria Document). Sections 108 and 109 of the Clean Air Act require that EPA carry out a periodic review and revision, where appropriate, of the air quality criteria (embodied in the Criteria Document) and national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) for criteria air pollutants such as PM. Details of EPA's plans for the review of the NAAQS for PM were initially announced in the Federal Register (62 FR 55201, October 23, 1997). EPA made a First External Review Draft of the updated Air Quality Criteria for Particulate Matter available for review by the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC) and members of the public in October 1999 (64 FR 57884, October 27, 1999). Following that public review period and a meeting of the CASAC in December 1999 (64 FR 61875, November 15, 1999), EPA revised the document as appropriate to incorporate CASAC and public comments, as well as to reflect many new studies on the effects of PM that were not available in time for discussion in the First External Review Draft. 

EPA then made a Second External Review Draft of the Air Quality Criteria for Particulate Matter available for CASAC and public review in April 2001 (66 FR 18929, April 12, 2001). Following that public review period and a second CASAC meeting in July 2001 (66 FR 34924, July 2, 2001), EPA again revised the document as appropriate to incorporate changes in response to CASAC and public comments and also made further revisions reflecting new studies on PM effects that had become available between issuance of the First and Second External Review Drafts. 

EPA then made a Third External Review Draft of the Air Quality Criteria for Particulate Matter available for CASAC and public review in May 2002 (67 FR 31303, May 9, 2002). Following that public review period and a third CASAC meeting in July 2002 (67 FR 41723, June 19, 2002), EPA again revised the document as appropriate to incorporate revisions in response to CASAC and public comments and also made further revisions reflecting new studies on PM effects that had become available between issuance of the Second and Third External Review Drafts, as well as reanalyses of certain existing studies occasioned after discovery of problems with applications of statistical software. 

EPA made a Fourth External Review Draft available for CASAC and public review in June 2003 (68 FR 36985). A public meeting with CASAC was held August 25-26, 2003, during which CASAC reached closure on Chapters 1,2,3,4,5, and 6, with only relatively minor final revisions to be made. No further public review is requested on these chapters. However, CASAC did not reach closure on Chapters 7 (toxicology), 8 (human health), and 9 (integrative synthesis), each of which had to be more extensively revised or, in the case of chapter 9, significantly restructured. CASAC then provided additional review comments on revised drafts of Chapters 7 and 8 (dated December 2003) and on further revised drafts of Chapters 7, 8, and 9 made available for CASAC and public review in June 2004. These revised draft chapters were reviewed by CASAC at a public meeting held July 20-21, 2004. Closure was reached on Chapters 7 and 8. A revised Chapter 9 (August 2004) was made available for public comment and was reviewed by CASAC via a publically accessible teleconference on September 20, 2004, at which time closure was reached on Chapter 9 and CASAC completed its overall review of the Criteria Document. The final version of the entire PM Criteria Document was issued in October 2004.},

  abstract        = {Evolution of number concentration of nanoparticles undergoing Brownian coagulation in the transition regime is studied theoretically and numerically. The results show that the curves of particle size distribution move toward the area with large particle diameters, the curve peak becomes lower and the range that particle diameters cover becomes wider as time elapses. In the process of coagulation the particles with small diameter disappear gradually and the particle size distribution remains a log-normal distribution. The change rate of the particle size distribution is more appreciable at the initial stage than that at the final stage. The initial Knudsen number has a significant effect on the coagulation rate which increases with decreasing the initial Knudsen number. The larger the initial geometric standard deviation is, the smaller the curve peak is, and the wider the area that curves cover is. The initial geometric standard deviation has a significant effect on the particle size distribution which can remain a self-preserving state when the initial geometric standard deviation is smaller than 2. With the increase of the diversity of initial particle size, the particle size distribution does not obey the log-normal distribution any more as time elapses. © 2011 Publishing House for Journal of Hydrodynamics.},

  abstract = {Experimental and numerical studies indicate that particle coagulation plays an important role in sootformation. However, to date, neither method has been able to conclusively determine the stage at which chemical precursors begin to coalesce. In the present study, molecular dynamics (MD) with on-the-fly quantum forces was used to investigate binary collisions between pyrene molecules. The molecular structure and internal motion were treated explicitly. Most of the runs were performed at 1600 K, within the temperature window of soot nucleation in flames. The MD simulations were successful in producing dimers with substantial collisional frequency and lifetimes far exceeding the equilibrium-based predictions, demonstrating that pyrene dimerization is physically realisically realistic in flame environments. The principal finding of the present study is the development of internal rotors by colliding pyrene molecules, the phenomenon responsible for stabilization of the forming dimer. Analysis of the MD results shows that the mechanism of stabilization is rooted in the pattern of energy transfer. The translational energy of the individual colliding molecules is trapped in internal rotors that emerge upon collision and in the vibrational modes of the dimer, including the van der Waals bond established between the pyrene molecules. This model extends the view of stabilization of aromatic species dimerization, with the implication that aromatic dimers of species as small as pyrene can survive long enough to evolve into soot nuclei.},

  abstract        = {Experimental and theoretical results for the rapid expansion of supercritical solutions (RESS-process) are presented. Experiments were carried out with the solvents carbon dioxide (CO2) and trifluoromethane (CHF3) and the organic solutes cholesterol, benzoic acid and griseofulvin. It is shown that for each of these solutes it is possible to produce particles in the size range of 200nm which leads to improved dissolution. Furthermore, to demonstrate the higher bioavailability of the micronized pharmaceutical griseofulvin as of the original material, results of a dissolution experiment are shown. Besides the experiments the flow and particle formation and growth in the expansion unit (inlet-capillary nozzle-supersonic free jet) of the RESS-process is modelled numerically. The model to calculate the flow field consists of mass, momentum and energy balances as well as the extended generalized Bender equation of state (egB-EoS). The flow is assumed to be steady, one-dimensional, viscid and non-adiabatic. The general dynamic equation (GDE) is included to model the particulate phase. The results of the modelling show that particle formation occurs in most of the cases mainly in the supersonic free jet and that the main mechanism for particle growth is coagulation. Furthermore, it can be inferred from the high particle number concentration at the Mach disk that particle growth by coagulation continues in the subsonic part of the free jet (expansion chamber). Experimental results with variation of additional air supply to the expansion chamber are presented to confirm the theoretical results. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.},

This study presents a chemical reaction sequence for the photo-CVD process to describe the production of silica coatings from the decomposition of tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS). The model incorporates photochemical reactions into known thermal reaction sequences involving gas-phase and surface reactions to describe the nanoparticle coating process. Modeled results of the photo-CVD process indicate that the dominant reactions for the production of silica coatings on the surface of the nanoparticles are the photodecomposition of TEOS and the removal of surface ethyl groups from adsorbed TEOS species. Relative concentrations of gas-phase and surface species are compared for different model configurations and system parameters. Modeled coating thicknesses agree well with experimental findings and demonstrate that coating thickness increases with increasing TEOS concentration and increased residence time within the reaction chamber. © 2011 American Chemical Society.},

  abstract        = {Experiments in a two-stage burner, with ethylene as the fuel, were conducted to further understand the mechanisms associated with the fragmentation of soot particles. Experiments were grouped in the following three categories, based on the main objective of the corresponding experiment: (i) the effect of different inert gases, Ar, He, N2 (ii) the effect of an increase in N2 dilution and O2 concentration (iii) and the effect of particle mobility size on the fragmentation. It was shown that the onset of the fragmentation depended on the presence of large aggregates in the flames. In addition, in the presence of aggregates, the rate of fragmentation was found to be inversely proportional to the peak temperature. It was postulated that at lower flame temperature where the soot burnout was delayed, O2 molecules were more likely to diffuse into the bridges between particles and burn them. Also, a role for OH oxidation during fragmentation was postulated by probability analysis, since fragmentation was experimentally shown to continue in the region of the flame where OH was present. © 2015 The Combustion Institute.},

  abstract      = {Experiments were made to form titanium and aluminum hydroxide particles in lab scale turbulent subsonic gas jets with nozzle diameters of 0.2 to 0.4 cm. Small clusters formed by homogeneous nucleation near the nozzle and grew by coagulation as they flowed downstream. Electron microscopy showed that the particles were rounded and unagglomerated, indicating that coalescence rates exceeded coagulation rates. The experiments demonstrate a method for producing unagglomerated fine metal oxide particles. Aerosol number concentrations and size distributions were measured for different nozzles, velocities, and positions in the jet using a Condensation Particle Counter and a Differential Mobility Analyzer. Number concentrations were in the range 107-1010 particles per cm3 of gas. Size distributions were lognormally shaped with median particle diameters of 10 to 100 nm and geometric standard deviations of 1.3 to 1.6.

The expression can be used to design turbulent jet particle generators.
Experiments were made to form titanium and aluminum hydroxide particles in lab scale turbulent subsonic gas jets with nozzle diameters of 0.2 to 0.4 cm. Small clusters formed by homogeneous nucleation near the nozzle and grew by coagulation as they flowed downstream. Electron microscopy showed that the particles were rounded and unagglomerated, indicating that coalescence rates exceeded coagulation rates. The experiments demonstrate a method for producing unagglomerated fine metal oxide particles. Aerosol number concentrations and size distributions were measured for different nozzles, velocities, and positions in the jet using a Condensation Particle Counter and a Differential Mobility Analyzer. Number concentrations were in the range 107-1010 particles per cm3 of gas. Size distributions were lognormally shaped with median particle diameters of 10 to 100 nm and geometric standard deviations of 1.3 to 1.6. The median particle diameters were correlated by a semiempirical expression which depended on the precursor vapor loading, axial position and jet velocity. The expression can be used to design turbulent jet particle generators.},

Increasing the size and density of flocculation body is the main approach to rapid particle removal or sedimentation in water. Aiming at the Brownian coagulation of fine particles, a new method of Taylor expansion moment construction of fractal flocs has been developed in this paper, incorporating the Taylor expansion approach based on the moment method and the fractal dimension of the floc structure originated from fractal theories. This method successfully overcomes the limit of previous moment methods that require pre-assumed particle size distribution. Results of the zero and second order moments of Brownian flocs from the proposed method are compared with those from the Laguerre method, integral moment method and finite element method. It is found that the higher accuracy and efficiency of computation have been achieved by the new method, compared to the previous ones. Effects of the fractal dimension on the zero and second order moments, geometric average volume and standard deviation are also analyzed using this method. The self-conservation characteristics of particle distribution is observed without presumption of initial distributions. Copyright © 2012 De Gruyter.},

We are reminded of the tragic outcomes of 'untenable' fire disasters such as at King's Cross underground station or Switzerland's St Gotthard tunnel. In these and many other cases, computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is at the forefront of active research into unravelling the probable causes of fires and helping to design structures and systems to ensure that they are less likely in the future. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is routinely used as an analysis tool in fire and combustion engineering as it possesses the ability to handle the complex geometries and characteristics of combustion and fire. This book shows engineering students and professionals how to understand and use this powerful tool in the study of combustion processes, and in the engineering of safer or more fire resistant (or conversely, more fire-efficient) structures. No other book is dedicated to computer-based fire dynamics tools and systems. It is supported by a rigorous pedagogy, including worked examples to illustrate the capabilities of different models, an introduction to the essential aspects of fire physics, examination and self-test exercises, fully worked solutions and a suite of accompanying software for use in industry standard modeling systems. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is widely used in engineering analysis; this is the only book dedicated to CFD modeling analysis in fire and combustion engineering Strong pedagogic features mean this book can be used as a text for graduate level mechanical, civil, structural and fire engineering courses, while its coverage of the latest techniques and industry standard software make it an important reference for researchers and professional engineers in the mechanical and structural sectors, and by fire engineers, safety consultants and regulators Strong author team (CUHK is a recognized centre of excellence in fire eng) deliver an expert package for students and professionals, showing both theory and applications.

Here, after an overview of the history of this technology, the current state of knowledge on the role of flame process variables (additives, mixing etc.) on the characteristics of product powders is summarized in a tutorial fashion. The fundamentals of particle formation and growth are highlighted by summarizing the dynamics of spherical particles that are reasonably well understood. The latest advances on the theory of aggregate particle dynamics that are typically encountered in flame synthesis of powders are presented. Specific applications in the manufacture of fumed silica, pigmentary titania, alumina, and other oxide and non-oxide ceramic powders are reviewed. Finally, research needs are highlighted by pointing out the most promising areas for advancing the field with emphasis on instrumentation and need for detailed simulators of the process accounting for the concurrent chemistry, transport and aggregate particle dynamics.

  abstract = {Flame-based synthesis of nanoparticles is an important chemical process used for the manufacturing of metal oxide particles. In this aerosol process, nanoparticle precursors are injected into a high-temperature flame that causes precursor oxidation, nucleation, and subsequent growth of solid particles through a variety of processes. To aid computational design of the aerosol process, a large-eddy simulation (LES) based computational framework is developed here. A flamelet-based model is used to describe both combustion and precursor oxidation. The solid phase nanoparticle evolution is described using a bivariate number density function (NDF) approach. The high-dimensional NDF transport equation is solved using a novel conditional quadrature method of moments (CQMOM) approach. Particle phase processes such as collision-based aggregation, and temperature-induced sintering are included in this description. This LES framework is used to study an experimental methane/air flame that used titanium tetrachloride to generate titania particles. The simulation results show that the evolution process of titania nanoparticles is largely determined by the competition between particle aggregation and sintering at downstream locations in the reactor. It is shown that the bivariate description improves the prediction of particle size characteristics, although the large uncertainty in inflow and operating conditions prevent a full scale validation. © 2013 American Institute of Chemical Engineers AIChE J 60: 459–472, 2014},

  abstract        = {For flows where the particle number density is low and the Stokes number is relatively high, as found when sand or ice is ingested into aircraft gas turbine engines, streams of particles can cross each other's path or bounce from a solid surface without being influenced by inter-particle collisions. The aim of this work is to develop an Eulerian method to simulate these types of flow. To this end, a two-node quadrature-based moment method using 13 moments is proposed. In the proposed algorithm thirteen moments of particle velocity, including cross-moments of second order, are used to determine the weights and abscissas of the two nodes and to set up the association between the velocity components in each node. Previous Quadrature Method of Moments (QMOM) algorithms either use more than two nodes, leading to increased computational expense, or are shown here to give incorrect results under some circumstances. This method gives the computational efficiency advantages of only needing two particle phase velocity fields whilst ensuring that a correct combination of weights and abscissas is returned for any arbitrary combination of particle trajectories without the need for any further assumptions. Particle crossing and wall bouncing with arbitrary combinations of angles are demonstrated using the method in a two-dimensional scheme. The ability of the scheme to include the presence of drag from a carrier phase is also demonstrated, as is bouncing off surfaces with inelastic collisions. The method is also applied to the Taylor–Green vortex flow test case and is found to give results superior to the existing two-node QMOM method and is in good agreement with results from Lagrangian modelling of this case. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract      = {Fractal aggregate coagulation is described within a general framework of multivariate population dynamics. The effect of aggregate morphology on the coagulation rate, is taken into account explicitly, introducing in addition to aggregate particle size, the aggregate fractal dimension, as a second independent variable. A simple constitutive law is derived for determining the fractal dimension of an aggregate, resulting from a coagulation event between aggregates with different fractal dimensions. An efficient Monte Carlo method was implemented to solve the resulting bivariate Brownian coagulation equation, in the limits of continuum and free molecular flow regimes. The results indicate that as the population mean fractal dimension goes from its initial value towards its asymptotic value, the distribution of fractal dimension remains narrow for both flow regimes. The evolution of the mean aggregate size in the continuum regime is found to be nearly independent of aggregate morphology. In the free molecular regime however, the effects of aggregate morphology, as embodied in its fractal dimension, become more important. In this case the evolution of the aggregate size distribution cannot be described by the traditional approach, that employs a constant fractal dimension. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

  abstract        = {Gas-phase (aerosol) technology is used widely in manufacture of various nanostructured commodities at tons/hour today. So it is quite promising for synthesis of sophisticated nanoparticles motivating basic and applied research. Frequently such nanoparticles are made as clusters of primary particles (PPs) by chemical reaction, aerosol coagulation, sintering, surface growth and even fragmentation. When PPs are bonded by strong chemical forces, they are termed aggregates. As such they are sought in catalysis, lightguide preform manufacture and, most importantly, as components in electronic devices (sensors, batteries). When PPs and aggregates are held together by rather weak, physical forces, they form agglomerates. These are attractive in nanocomposites and fluid suspensions (paints, nanofluids, bioimaging). Such clusters may have also distinct health effects, beyond those of equivalent spherical particles. Agglomerates and aggregates are characterized by microscopy, electromagnetic scattering and mass mobility measurements in terms of their volume-equivalent radius, radius of gyration and/or mobility radii in the free molecular and continuum regimes along with the corresponding power laws (fractal dimension, Df). Coagulation and sintering largely determine nanoparticle structure. Coagulation of PPs leads to agglomerates of Df = 1.78 and 1.91 in the continuum and free-molecular regimes, respectively. The coagulation rate of agglomerates is higher than that of volume-equivalent spheres in the free molecular regime. Agglomerates attain also a self-preserving size distribution by coagulation facilitating process design for their manufacture. Mesoscale simulations elucidate the sintering (or coalescence) of agglomerates to aggregates and narrowing of their PP size distribution. Once agglomerates start to sinter, they follow a power law to aggregates and eventually to compact (spherical) particles, regardless of composition and initial PP size distribution. Aggregate properties are in-between those of the initial agglomerate and the fully coalesced sphere. Finally the stability of agglomerates under ultrasonication, stretching, fluid dispersion, impaction and capillary condensation is highlighted. © 2013 The Society of Powder Technology Japan.

  abstract        = {Gas-phase synthesis of fine solid particles leads to fractal-like structures whose transport and light scattering properties differ from those of their spherical counterparts. Self-preserving size distribution theory provides a useful methodology for analyzing the asymptotic behavior of such systems. Apparent inconsistencies in previous treatments of the self-preserving size distributions in the free molecule regime are resolved. Integro-differential equations for fractal-like particles in the continuum and near continuum regimes are derived and used to calculate the self-preserving and quasi-self-preserving size distributions for agglomerates formed by Brownian coagulation. The results for the limiting case (the continuum regime) were compared with the results of other authors. For these cases the finite difference method was in good in agreement with previous calculations in the continuum regime. A new analysis of aerosol agglomeration for the entire Knudsen number range was developed and compared with a monodisperse model; Higher agglomeration rates were found for lower fractal dimensions, as expected from previous studies. Effects of fractal dimension, pressure, volume loading and temperature on agglomerate growth were investigated. The agglomeration rate can be reduced by decreasing volumetric loading or by increasing the pressure. In laminar flow, an increase in pressure can be used to control particle growth and polydispersity. For Df = 2, an increase in pressure from 1 to 4 bar reduces the collision radius by about 30%. Varying the temperature has a much smaller effect on agglomerate coagulation. © 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).},

  abstract        = {Gravitational settling has been considered to be one of the limiting factors to stratospheric aerosol lifetime and therefore to the practicability and effectiveness of stratospheric solar radiation management (S-SRM, which is one of the approaches being considered for planetary-scale geoengineering or climate engineering). Given the property of numerical diffusion that is associated with sedimentation as a transport process on a discretized global grid, it is important to represent this process as accurately as possible. In this paper, newly developed sedimentation schemes are presented and validated against an analytical solution. Sensitivity studies with an aerosol chemistry general circulation model are conducted with monodisperse aerosol particles of fixed size and follow two main aims: first, to evaluate the relevance of sedimentation for the aerosol lifetime and distribution in the stratosphere as a function of particle size, and second, to explore the influence of numerical diffusion on these patterns. The relevance of sedimentation is explored further with respect to other relevant particle properties, such as shape and density. It is shown that the role of sedimentation in determining stratospheric particle lifetime is a complex function of all particle properties combined. Especially with respect to sulfate aerosol, the influence of sedimentation is conditioned by the temporal evolution of particle size. Although large enough particles for considerable sedimentation mediated removal are observed in the context of volcanic eruptions, it seems uncertain whether secondary particles of an equivalent size would be obtained in the context of S-SRM, pointing to the need for an accurate representation of aerosol growth dynamics. Key Points Sedimentation is key to limiting vertical transport of stratospheric aerosol. A non-diffusive scheme allows getting the vertical distribution right. The role of sedimentation is a complex function of all particle parameters. ©2013. American Geophysical Union. All Rights Reserved.},

Approximate results are derived by matching the rate of rise of the nucleation rate, ignoring vapour depletion, to its rate of fall due to condensational growth alone. The nucleation rate when these two rates are equal is identified as its peak value J p, and 2J p divided by the rate gives the number of particles nucleated. Agreement between this approximation and accurate numerical results for dibutyl phthalate vapour in Nitrogen is very good for the cases considered. For moderate inlet-wall temperature differences, particle production is roughly constant over much of the tube cross-section but falls near the wall. However, for large temperature differences, a peak in particle production occurs near the wall, due to the very rapid rate of change in conditions there. As the nucleation increases, the fraction of inflowing vapour condensing on the wall decreases and an approximate analytic formula for this fraction is presented. This formula is very accurate provided more than about 20% of the vapour condenses on the wall. For lower wall condensation fractions, the formula under predicts the aerosol mass, however these results ignore the effect of particle deposition. The influence of seed aerosol on quenching nucleation is considered and found to depend on whether significant particle production occurs near the wall. An estimate of deposition by thermophoresis suggests that it is negligible for moderate wall-inlet temperature differences, but important for high temperature differences where there is significant particle production and growth near the wall.

A modeled transport equation for this central quantity was first derived from phenomenological considenrations [6] for non-poremixed turbulent combustion. More recently, an exact but unclosed transport equation for the density of a propagating surface has been established, leading to improvements in premixed turbulent combustion modeling. The same general framework, together with concepts borrowed from Vervisch et al. [16] may be used to describe non-premixed turbulent combustion. In the opresent work, two equivalent transport equations for the flame surface density Σ¯ corresponding to the stoichiometric iso‐level value of the mixture fraction Σ¯ are analyzed. The first equation is similar to a PDF transport equation whereas the second one introduces the concept of an effective propagation speed. Flame surface density Σ¯ and terms in Σ¯ equations are examined using direct simulations of a two-dimensional spatial turbulent mixing layer. In a first step, our study is limited to a constant density flow without shear. Simple models are also proposed for the source and snk terms in the Σ¯ equations.},

The results indicated that it was feasible to separate part of metals from flue gases by collecting fly ash at different temperatures. On the basis of their separation temperature, heavy and alkali metals could be divided into three groups: group A included Zn, K and P, which converted from gaseous phase to liquid or solid when temperature was above 600°C. Pb and Cu were the metals of group B, with optimum transformation temperature of 400°C. Na and As belonged to group C, with conversion temperatures of 300°C. Moreover, the effect of temperature gradient on heavy and alkali metal gas-solid transformation was also experimentally investigated. It was observed that the temperature gradient could promote the gas-solid conversion of heavy and alkali metals. However, too high a temperature gradient would suppress the formation of fine particles. The peak of conversion rate for K, Pb and Na occurred at 434°C s1, while that of P and Cu was 487°C s1. © 2010 The Author(s).},

  abstract = {In practical combustors, high-intensity mixing is often desirable in order to minimize combustor volume and also minimize the production of certain pollutants. However, high-intensity mixing may also lead to local quenching and, potentially, a failure to stabilize the flame. Two crucial issues are what fraction of the reactive mixture is quenched and how rapidly these regions reignite. To address this question over a range of conditions at relatively high Reynolds numbers, the one-dimensional turbulence (ODT) model is adopted. Results are reported for a piloted planar temporal CO/H 2 /N 2 jet flame configuration at a nozzle Reynolds number of 15,000 and three global mixing rates, U 0 / d 0 =8.3 2 10 3 s m 1 , 1.3 2 10 4 s m 1 , and 2 2 10 4 s m 1 . The fraction of extinguished stoichiometric regions increases with the global mixing rate as expected from laminar flamelet theory. The maximum fraction of extinguished regions, measured as a volume fraction of stoichiometric mixture, is 5%, 17%, and 40%, respectively, for the three mixing rates. The fraction of extinguished regions is significantly greater than the probability that the scalar dissipation rate exceeds the critical value for extinction, indicating that the reignition process is slow relative to the extinction process. The rate of reignition is found to scale roughly with the global mixing rate; this means that reignition is more rapid for conditions favorable to extinction.},

A log-normal size distribution is assumed for the host and coating particles to describe coagulation and a monodisperse size distribution is used for the coating particles to describe sintering. As an example, coating of titania particles with silica in a continuous flow hot-wall reactor was modeled. High temperatures, low reactant concentrations, and large host particle surface areas favored smoother coatings in the parameter range: temperature 1700-1800 K, host particle number concentration 1 x 10 5-1 x 10 7 #/cm 3, average host particle size 1 μm, inlet coating reactant concentration (SiCl 4) 2 x 10 -7-2 x 10 -10 mol/cm 3, and various surface reaction rates. The fraction of silica deposited on the TiO 2 particles decreased by more than seven times with a hundredfold increase in SiCl 4 inlet concentration because of the resulted increase in the average SiO 2 particle size under the assumed coating conditions. Increasing the TiO 2 particle number concentration resulted in higher Scavenging efficiency of SiO 2. In the TiO 2/SiO 2 system it is likely that surface reaction as well as scavenging play important roles in the coating process. The results agree qualitatively with experimental observations of TiO 2 particles coated in situ with silica.},

  abstract = {In the context of Large Eddy Simulation (LES) solely for the momentum transport equation there may be found several models for the turbulent subgrid fluxes. Furthermore, among those relying on the eddy diffusivity approach, each model may be based on different invariants of the strain rate. Besides, when heat and mass transfer are also considered, closures for the subgrid turbulent scalar fluxes are also required. Hence, different model combinations may be considered. Additionally, when other physical phenomena are included, such as combustion, further subgrid modelling is involved. Therefore, in the present study a LES simulation of a turbulent diffusion flame is performed and different combination of subgrid models are used in order to analyse the numerical effects in the simulations. Several models for the turbulent momentum subgrid fluxes are considered, both constant and dynamically evaluated Schmidt numbers. Regarding combustion, in the context of the Flamelet/Progress-Variable (FPV) model, with an assumed probability density function for the turbulent-chemistry interactions and four different closures for the subgrid mixture fraction variance are considered. Hence, a large number of model combinations are possible. The present study highlights the need for a consistent closure of subgrid effects. It is shown that, in the context of an FPV modelling, incorrect capture of subgrid mixing results in a flame lift-off for the studied flame (DLR A diffusion flame), even though experimentally an attached flame was reported. It is found that a consistent formulation is required, that is, all subgrid closures should become active in the same regions of the domain to avoid modelling inconsistencies. In contrast, when the classical flamelet approach is used, no lift-off is observed. The reason is that the classical flamelet includes only a limited subset of the possible flame states, i.e. only includes burning flamelets and extinguished flamelets for scalar dissipation rates past the extinction one.},

The distributions of number concentration, mass concentration and particle average volume driven by coagulation, advection and diffusion are obtained. The developed TEMOM method has no prior requirement for the particle size distribution (PSD), and it is a promising method to approximate the aerosol general dynamics equation (GDE). The fluid and particle fields are coupled together and are presented with three non-dimensional parameters (i.e., Reynolds number, Re; Schmidt number based on particle moment, Sc M, and Damkohler number, Da) in the governing equations. The temporal evolutions of the first three moments are discussed for different Damkohler numbers (Da=0.5, 1.0, 2.0). As the fluid flow evolves in time, the number concentration of nanoparticles decreases gradually, while the particle average volume increase. The distribution of number concentration, mass concentration, and average volume of nanoparticles are spatially inhomogeneous due to the mixing of coherent vortex structures. Far away from the eddy structure, the effect of the fluid advection on particle coagulation is small; however, the particle coagulation within the eddy core has an obvious wave-like distribution because of the large-scale eddy. The results reveal that the coherent structures play a significant role in the particle Brownian coagulation in the mixing layer. The particle coagulation affects quantitatively the distribution of particle number concentration, volume concentration and average diameter, but the qualitative characteristics of these distributions remain unchanged. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract        = {In the present study, the evolution of size distributions of soot particles in premixed laminar flames is investigated. A computationally efficient stochastic approach is used to model the dynamics of the soot particle ensemble. The stochastic method is enhanced to include a formalism for modeling coagulation at high pressures. A detailed kinetic model is used to describe gas phase reactions and the formation, growth, and oxidation of soot particles. Four fuel rich laminar premixed flames at different pressure are investigated. It is found that calculated size distributions vary markedly in shape between the different flames. The distributions calculated in the two flames at elevated pressure and in the sub-atmospheric flame exhibit log-normal shape in the post-flame zone. In contrast, a bimodal distribution is found for the atmospheric flame, which persists throughout the entire flame. The bimodal behavior could be attributed to continuous nucleation. Furthermore, the effect of surface ageing, i.e., the deactivation of sites on the soot particles' surface available for reaction with gas phase species, is investigated. For this purpose, a definition of a particle's age is introduced, and age distributions are calculated. Subsequently, it was investigated if the surface reactivity could be correlated with the particle age. Two different correlations were investigated: (a) a step-function attributing a high surface activity to young particles and low activity to old particles and (b) an exponential function giving a smooth transition of surface activity with particle age. Good agreement with measured soot volume fractions could be obtained with both approaches. The decay constant in the exponential correlation was found to be a linear function of maximum flame temperature for three of the four calculated flames. For these three flames, the experimentally established trend that surface deactivation proceeds faster at higher temperatures could thus be reproduced. © 2004 The Combustion Institute.

The moments of the joint Probility Density Function (PDF) of these three quantities are solved using the Direct Quadrature Method of Moments (DQMOM). This method allows for an accurate prediction of the moments without the cost of expensive methods like Direct Simulation Monte-Carlo (DSMC). The source terms for the transport equations include nucleation, coagulation, condensation, surface growth, and oxidation. The model, referred to as Volume-Surface- Hydrogen (VSH), is applied insimulations of a series of rich laminar premixed flames. The model is able to predict soot volume fraction and primary particle diameter with good accuracy.

The GDE developed here is an extension of the coagulation equation solution method developed by Kari Lehtinen, wherein particles exist only at nodes, as opposed to continuous bins in the sectional method. The results have been tested by comparison where simple analytical solutions are available, and are shown to be in excellent agreement. By example we apply the model to the formation and growth of Aluminum particles. The important features of the model are that it is simple to comprehend; the software, which we call nodal GDE solver (NGDE), is relatively compact; and the code is well documented internally, so that users may apply it to their specific needs or make modifications as required.

For this purpose a full finite volume model has been combined with a state-of-the-art trust-region optimisation algorithm for process control. Verified against experimental data, specific process conditions are determined accomplishing a versatile range of prescribed product properties. The main achievement of the optimisation is the possibility to control the different mechanisms in the particle formation process by mainly adjusting the temperature profile. Due to a successful separation of the nucleation and growth process, significantly narrower particle size distributions are obtained. Moreover, the presented optimisation framework establishes rate constants based on measured data. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

A hot DEHS vapor issues through a circular nozzle into slowly moving cold air. Vapor concentration and temperatures are such that particles are formed via homogeneous nucleation close to the nozzle upon mixing with the surrounding air. The vapor is completely quenched in the nucleation regime so that further particle growth is controlled by coagulation. A simple growth dynamics model is presented and the theory is used to design a generation system that produces liquid aerosols at a very high number current [up to 1012 particles (s)]. The aerosol properties can be controlled by two easily adjustable parameters. The aerosol properties are related to these parameters by simple scaling laws. The results of measurements of the number current and the average particle size support these scaling laws. © 1993.},

The considered models are the nonlinear integro-partial differential equations on time, size and space, which describe different processes of atmospheric aerosols including condensation, nucleation, coagulation, deposition, sources as well as turbulent mixing. The proposed method reduces the complex general aerosol dynamic equation to two one-dimensional splitting equations in each time interval, and further the wavelet method and the upstream finite difference method are proposed for solving the particle size directional and the spatial directional splitting equations. By the method, the aerosol size spectrum is represented by a combination of Daubechies' wavelets and substituted into the size-directional splitting equation at each time step. The class of Daubechies' wavelets in the wavelet-Galerkin scheme as trial and weight functions has the advantages of both compact support and orthonormality which can efficiently simulate the sharp shape distribution of aerosols along the particle size direction. Numerical experiments are given to show the efficient performance of the method. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract        = {In this paper, a splitting characteristic method is developed for solving general multi-component aerosol transports in atmosphere, which can efficiently compute the aerosol transports by using large time step sizes. The proposed characteristic finite difference method (C-FDM) can solve the multi-component aerosol distributions in high dimensional domains over large ranges of concentrations and for different aerosol types. The C-FDM is first tested to compute the moving of a Gaussian concentration hump. Comparing with the Runge-Kutta method (RKM), our C-FDM can use very large time step sizes. Using Δt = 0.1, the accuracy of our C-FDM is 10−4, but the RKM only gets the accuracy of 10−2 using a small Δt = 0.01 and the accuracy of 10−3 even using a much smaller Δt = 0.002. A simulation of sulfate transport in a varying wind field is then carried out by the splitting C-FDM, where the sulfate pollution is numerically showed expanding along the wind direction and the effects of the different time step sizes and different wind speeds are analyzed. Further, a realistic multi-component aerosol transport over an area in northeastern United States is studied. Concentrations of PM2.5 sulfate, ammonium, nitrate are high in the urban area, and low in the marine area, while sea salts of sodium and chloride mainly exist in the marine area. The normalized mean bias and the normalized mean error of the predicted PM2.5 concentrations are −6.5% and 24.1% compared to the observed data measured at monitor stations. The time series of numerical aerosol concentration distribution show that the strong winds can move the aerosol concentration peaks horizontally for a long distance, such as from the urban area to the rural area and from the marine area to the urban and rural area. Moreover, we also show the numerical time duration patterns of the aerosol concentration distributions due to the affections of the turbulence and the deposition removal. The developed splitting C-FDM algorithm can be applied to model spatial multi-component aerosol transport problems in large domains in atmosphere. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

The aim of this work is twofold. The first goal is to compute a small number of space-dependent empirical eigenfunctions, so that a low-dimensional representation of the data generated by the large model of the discretized partial differential equations can be obtained using a weighted sum of these few eigenfunctions (POD modes). It is found that only six modes are needed for an accurate representation of the data in an extended range of inflow velocities. This large data reduction takes into account not only chemical kinetics but also transport phenomena in a full two-dimensional context and constitutes the first step toward the construction of low-dimensional dynamic models for the opposed-jet system. It is also found that the PODs have very good interpolatory properties. The second goal is to use part of the available data (i.e., partial measurements), together with the computed modes, to estimate, or, in the terminology of process control, to observe, the “unmeasured” quantities. It is found that only a small number of measurements are needed to obtain accurate estimates of the rest of the data.},

The pressure-based method developed herein is a spectral implementation of the sequential steps followed in the predictor-corrector type of algorithms: it includes the effects of density fluctuations caused by spatial inhomogeneities in temperature and species. The velocity and pressure field are solved in the spectral space while the scalars and density field are solved in the physical space. The presented results reveal that the autoignition spots originate and evolve at locations where (1) the composition corresponds to a small range around a specific mixture fraction, and (2) the conditional scalar dissipation rate is low. A careful examination of the data obtained indicates that the autoignition spots originate in the vortex cores, and the hot gases travel outward as combustion progresses. Hence, the applicability of the transient laminar flamelet model for this problem is questioned. The dependence of autoignition characteristics on parameters such as (1) the initial eddy-turnover time and (2) the initial ratio of length scale of scalars to that of velocities are investigated. Certain implications of new results on the conditional moment closure modeling are discussed.},

  abstract        = {In this paper, we numerically study particle formation in the rapid expansion of supercritical solution (RESS) process in a two dimensional, axisymmetric geometry, for a benzoic acid + CO2 system. The fluid is described by the classical Navier-Stokes equation, with the thermodynamic pressure being replaced by a generalized pressure tensor. Homogenous particle nucleation, transport, condensation and coagulation are described by a general dynamic equation, which is solved using the method of moments. The results show that the maximal nucleation rate and number density occurs near the nozzle exit, and particle precipitation inside the nozzle might not be ignored. Particles grow mainly across the shocks. Fluid in the shear layer of the jet shows a relatively low temperature, high nucleation rate, and carries particles with small sizes. On the plate, particles within the jet have smaller average size and higher geometric mean, while particles outside the jet shows a larger average size and a lower geometric mean. Increasing the preexpansion temperature will increase both the average particle size and standard deviation. The preexpansion pressure does not show a monotonic dependency with the average particle size. Increasing the distance between the plate and the nozzle exit might decrease the particle size. For all the cases in this paper, the average particle size on the plate is on the order of tens of nanometers. © 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

  abstract      = {In this study, the characteristic time scale of black carbon (BC) aging due to condensation of hygroscopic species was parameterized as a function of the condensing species concentration and the size distribution of BC particles. The aging time scale defined based on the BC mass concentration was shown to increase with BC particle size as well as with polydispersity of the size distribution. The effects of the BC particle size distribution on the aging time scale are shown to be considerable in the continuum regime, whereas the aging time scale tends to converge to a constant value in the free-molecule regime. The polydispersity effect was shown to be significant except for extraordinarily small particles.When the aging time scale was defined based on the BC number concentration, the dependency of the aging time scale on polydispersity is much smaller because the effect of slow aging of largest particles is compensated by fast aging of smallest particles. The aging time scale was also shown to be a strong function of the condensing species concentration. The result of this study implies that the aging time scale parameterizations suggested in the previous studies, which did not take into account the effects of condensing species concentration and particle size distribution, cannot be easily generalized for being applied to global model simulations.

For the numerical solution of the population balance model the conditional quadrature method of moments is employed and implemented through user-defined scalars and functions in the computational fluid dynamics code ANSYS/Fluent 12. The approach is validated by comparing model predictions with experiments (from the literature) conducted in an air–water stirred tank equipped with a Rushton turbine and a porous sparger. First predictions are compared with the experimentally measured mean Sauter diameter. The comparison highlights that the modeling approach is capable of predicting the main feature of the system.

Soot particles are modelled as aggregates containing primary particles, which are built from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), the main building blocks of a primary particle (PP). The connectivity of the primary particles is stored and used to determine the rounding of the soot particles due to surface growth and condensation processes. Two neighbouring primary particles are replaced by one if the coalescence level between the two primary particles reaches a threshold.

This two-dimensional model incorporates fluid dynamics, laser heating, gas phase and surface phase chemical reactions, and aerosol dynamics, with particle transport and evolution by convection, diffusion, thermophoresis, nucleation, surface growth, coagulation, and coalescence processes. Because of the complexity of the problem at hand, the simulation was carried out via several sub-models. First, the chemically reacting flow inside the reactor was simulated in three dimensions in full geometric detail, but with no aerosol dynamics and with highly simplified chemistry. Second, the reaction zone was simulated using an axisymmetric two-dimensional CFD model, whose boundary conditions were obtained from the first step. Last, a two-dimensional aerosol dynamics model was used to study the silicon nanoparticle formation using more complete silane decomposition chemistry, together with the temperature and velocities extracted from the reaction zone CFD simulation. A bivariate model was used to describe the evolution of particle size and morphology. The aggregates were modeled by a moment method, assuming a lognormal distribution in particle volume. This was augmented by a single balance equation for primary particles that assumed locally equal number of primary particles per aggregate and fractal dimension. The model predicted the position and size at which the primary particle size is frozen in, and showed that increasing the peak temperature was a more effective means of improving particle yield than increasing silane concentration or flowrate.},

  abstract = {In this work, an integrated Large Eddy Simulation (LES) model is developed for sooting turbulent nonpremixed flames and validated in a laboratory scale flame. The integrated approach leverages state-of-the-art developments in both soot modeling and turbulent combustion modeling and gives special consideration to the small-scale interactions between turbulence, soot, and chemistry. The oxidation of the fuel and the formation of gas-phase soot precursors is described by the Flamelet/Progress Variable model, which has been previously extended to account for radiation losses. However, previous DNS studies have shown that Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH), the immediate precursors of soot particles, exhibit significant unsteady effects due to relatively slow chemistry. To model these unsteady effects, a transport equation is solved for a lumped PAH species. In addition, due to the removal of PAH from the gas-phase, alternative definitions of the mixture fraction, progress variable, and enthalpy are proposed. The evolution of the soot population is modeled with the Hybrid Method of Moments (HMOM), an efficient statistical model requiring the solution of only a few transport equations describing statistics of the soot population. The filtered source terms in these equations that describe the various formation, growth, and destruction processes are closed with a recently developed presumed subfilter PDF approach that accounts for the high spatial intermittency of soot. The integrated LES model is validated in a piloted natural gas turbulent jet diffusion flame and is shown to predict the magnitude of the maximum soot volume fraction in the flame relatively accurately, although the maximum soot volume fraction is shown to be rather sensitive to the subfilter scalar dissipation rate model.},

To identify the major contributors to the molecular growth mechanism in opposed-flow flames, we employed flame-sampling molecular-beam mass spectrometry with electron ionization (EI) and in situ gas-chromatography (GC) with mass spectrometric detection. The EI and GC-EI mass spectra indicate that several pathways with different building blocks can contribute to molecular growth. Besides the commonly accepted hydrogen-abstraction-C2H2-addition steps, we found reactions of the methyl radical to be important steps. This observation is also supported by the complexity of the mass spectra which indicates that at least one of the building blocks is rather small. The importance of phenyl radicals as building blocks seems to be limited. We also sampled nascent soot particles from premixed atmospheric-pressure flames of the above mentioned fuels and used helium-ion microscopy to unravel the influence of the fuel structure on the morphology of the sampled particles. While differences in flame temperatures and residence times are known to influence the particle sizes, the observed different morphologies are likely due to slightly different C/O ratios and potentially the chemical nature of the fuel.},

The control algorithms are designed on the basis of reduced-order models, utilize measurements of principle moments of the PSD, and are tailored to address different control objectives for the continuous and batch processes. For continuous particulate processes, we develop a hybrid predictive control strategy to stabilize a continuous crystallizer at an open-loop unstable steady-state. The hybrid predictive control strategy employs logic-based switching between model predictive control (MPC) and a fall-back bounded controller with a well-defined stability region. The strategy is shown to provide a safety net for the implementation of MPC algorithms with guaranteed stability closed-loop region. For batch particulate processes, the control objective is to achieve a final PSD with desired characteristics subject to both manipulated input and product quality constraints. An optimization-based predictive control strategy that incorporates these constraints explicitly in the controller design is formulated and applied to a seeded batch crystallizer. The strategy is shown to be able to reduce the total volume of the fines by 13.4% compared to a linear cooling strategy, and is shown to be robust with respect to modeling errors. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract      = {Industrial production of carbon blacks and various oxide powders (silica, titania) is commercially carried out in turbulent conditions. A theoretical study was conducted to analyze the interplay of chemical reaction, Brownian and shear-induced coagulation in nonisothermal, highly turbulent flows, during gas phase production of ceramic powders. The dynamic behavior of these particles is modelled by approximating the particle size distribution by a lognormal function throughout the process. The validity of the lognormal approximation is investigated by comparing it to a detailed solution of the respective population balance equation. The effects of turbulent intensity, mass loading, process pressure, initial temperature and cooling rate on the polydispersity and average size of the product particles were investigated. It was found that initially, particle growth is controlled by chemical reaction and Brownian coagulation while later shear-induced coagulation becomes predominant. During the transition from Brownian to shear-induced coagulation the geometric standard deviation goes through a minimum. Thus, an optimal average particle diameter can be identified with respect to the polydispersity of the product powder. This optimal diameter decreases with increasing turbulent intensity and initial temperature, and with decreasing process pressure. © 1991.},

  abstract = {It is widely accepted that the hydrogen abstraction acetylene addition (HACA) mechanism accelerates the formation of benzenoid polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), like pyrene, from naphthylene via phenanthrene and stops at the formation of cyclopentaring-fused products like acenaphthylene/pyracyclene. In this experimental study it was found that PAH growth initiated/carried by the addition of any C2Hx radical/neutral species can continue beyond acenaphthylene resulting in cyclopentaring-fused PAHs (CP-PAHs) like fluoranthene more preferably compared to the HACA pathways forming benzenoid-PAHs like pyrene. Similarly, production of naphthalene from benzene via HACA was also found to be less probable. On the other hand, hydrogen abstraction and vinyl radical addition (HAVA) pathways seem to be more promising for producing PAHs during aliphatic hydrocarbon pyrolysis, except polyacetylenes, at least up to moderate temperature (∼1300K). These interesting outcomes were extracted from the gas-phase products of pyrolysis of acetylene and ethylene detected by using an in situ direct sampling vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) single photon ionization (SPI) time of flight mass spectrometry (TOFMS) technique. Small aliphatic products to large PAHs up to m/z=324 were observed. Observed products mass spectra showed a remarkable sequence of mass peaks at regular intervals of mass number 24 in acetylene pyrolysis products and at intervals of mass number 26 in the case of ethylene pyrolysis products, indicating the role of particular corresponding radicals such as C2H and C2H3 in products formation. Inclusion of reaction pathways reported here in existing kinetic models will be helpful to better predict especially fuel rich combustion phenomena for which existing models are inadequate. It will also be useful for understanding carbonaceous dust formation in the interstellar atmosphere.},

  abstract = {Jacobian-free Newton–Krylov (JFNK) methods are synergistic combinations of Newton-type methods for superlinearly convergent solution of nonlinear equations and Krylov subspace methods for solving the Newton correction equations. The link between the two methods is the Jacobian-vector product, which may be probed approximately without forming and storing the elements of the true Jacobian, through a variety of means. Various approximations to the Jacobian matrix may still be required for preconditioning the resulting Krylov iteration. As with Krylov methods for linear problems, successful application of the JFNK method to any given problem is dependent on adequate preconditioning. JFNK has potential for application throughout problems governed by nonlinear partial differential equations and integro-differential equations. In this survey paper, we place JFNK in context with other nonlinear solution algorithms for both boundary value problems (BVPs) and initial value problems (IVPs). We provide an overview of the mechanics of JFNK and attempt to illustrate the wide variety of preconditioning options available. It is emphasized that JFNK can be wrapped (as an accelerator) around another nonlinear fixed point method (interpreted as a preconditioning process, potentially with significant code reuse). The aim of this paper is not to trace fully the evolution of JFNK, nor to provide proofs of accuracy or optimal convergence for all of the constituent methods, but rather to present the reader with a perspective on how JFNK may be applicable to applications of interest and to provide sources of further practical information.},

  abstract = {Kinetic equations arise in a wide variety of physical systems and efficient numerical methods are needed for their solution. Moment methods are an important class of approximate models derived from kinetic equations, but require closure to truncate the moment set. In quadrature-based moment methods (QBMM), closure is achieved by inverting a finite set of moments to reconstruct a point distribution from which all unclosed moments (e.g. spatial fluxes) can be related to the finite moment set. In this work, a novel moment-inversion algorithm, based on 1-D adaptive quadrature of conditional velocity moments, is introduced and shown to always yield realizable distribution functions (i.e. non-negative quadrature weights). This conditional quadrature method of moments (CQMOM) can be used to compute exact N-point quadratures for multi-valued solutions (also known as the multi-variate truncated moment problem), and provides optimal approximations of continuous distributions. In order to control numerical errors arising in volume averaging and spatial transport, an adaptive 1-D quadrature algorithm is formulated for use with CQMOM. The use of adaptive CQMOM in the context of QBMM for the solution of kinetic equations is illustrated by applying it to problems involving particle trajectory crossing (i.e. collision-less systems), elastic and inelastic particle–particle collisions, and external forces (i.e. fluid drag).},

Numerical simulations were performed by using a detailed reaction mechanism containing 175 species and 1086 reactions with PAH formation up to pyrene and a sectional soot model. The soot model consists of inception as a result of the collision of two pyrene molecules, heterogeneous surface growth and oxidation following the hydrogen abstraction acetylene addition (HACA) mechanism, and soot particle coagulation and PAH surface condensation. Comparisons with available experimental data indicate that the numerical model reproduces successfully the influence of pressure on the flame structure and soot production. All the soot formation processes are enhanced with increasing pressure and HACA dominates the soot mass growth over the pressure range considered. PAH condensation is the most sensitive process to pressure whereas the inception and HACA processes exhibit similar pressure dependency. These trends are directly related to the pressure dependence of the molar concentrations of the species involved in soot formation. The increase in the molar concentrations of benzene and pyrene with pressure results from both physical and chemical effects. Propargyl recombination and interconversion of phenyl to benzene dominate the formation of benzene low in the flame over the pressure range considered, though the contributions of the addition of acetylene to n-butadienyl radical increases significantly with pressure in the flame centerline region.},

  abstract = {Large eddy simulation (LES) is a promising tool for numerical simulations of reacting flows, especially when combustion instabilities are encountered. Nevertheless, a difficulty occurs in developing subgrid scale models for premixed combustion, because the flame front is generally too thin to be resolved on the computational grid. An approach based on the filtering of the balance equation for the progress variable c using a LES filter larger than the mesh size is proposed and investigated. Despite its similarities with the field description based on the G-equation, the advantage of this approach is that c and related quantities such as subgrid-scale flame surface density are physically well defined and may be easily extracted from direct numerical simulations (DNS) or experimental data to analyze and validate models. A three-dimensional DNS database where a laminar premixed flame interacts with a homogeneous and isotropic turbulent flowfield is used to investigate unresolved turbulent scalar transport and filtered reaction rate. The unresolved transport is found to exhibit a gradient or a countergradient feature, depending on the heat release parameter and the turbulence level. This finding is in aggreement with previous observations of the turbulent transport in Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations. Nevertheless, the unresolved convective flux is lower than the resolved one. Accordingly, model uncertainties will have probably less dramatic consequences than in RANS because a part of the countergradient phenomenon will be incorporated into the motion of the resolved flow structures. The filtered reaction rate is closed, introducing a subgrid-scale flame surface density, Σ, modeled, in a first step, with an algebraic expression similar to the Bray-Moss-Libby (BML) formulation widely used in RANS context. This concept is very attractive because it could be refined using, for example, a dynamic algebraic formulation or a balance equation for Σ.},

Simulation results of time-averaged velocity and concentration fields show excellent agreement with experimental data collected from Sandia’s FLAME facility using particle image velocimetry and planar laser induced fluorescence measurement techniques. For locations very near the base of the plume, i.e., X/Dp<0.5, the LES overpredicts the measured root-mean squared streamwise velocity and concentration and, in addition, is found to be highly sensitive to grid resolution. The cause of these discrepancies is attributed to unresolved buoyancy-induced vorticity generation on resolved scales of fluid motion that is currently not explicitly treated in the SGS turbulence models used for the LES.},

The particle is described using a moment method to approximate the particle general dynamics equations.

The results show that the changes of Schmidt number have the influence on the number concentration of nanoparticles only when the particle diameter is less than 1 nm for the fixed gas parameters. The number concentration of particles for small particles decreases more rapidly along the flow direction, and the nanoparticles with larger Schmidt number have a narrower distribution along the transverse direction. The smaller nanoparticles coagulate and disperse easily, grow rapidly hence show a stronger polydispersity. The smaller coagulation time scale can enhance the particle collision and coagulation. Frequented collision and coagulation bring a great increase in particle size. The large the Damkohler number is, the higher the particle polydispersity is. © 2007 Editorial Committee of Appl. Math.

Iron oxide particles were produced by flame spray pyrolysis of iron acetylacetonate in xylene/acetonitrile solutions and the resulting aerosol was in situ coated with silicon dioxide by oxidation of swirling hexamethlydisiloxane vapor. The process allows independent control of the core Fe2O3 (maghemite) particle properties and the thickness of their silica coating film. This ensures that the nonmagnetic SiO2 layer can be closely controlled and minimized. The optimal SiO2 content for complete (hermetic) encapsulation of the magnetic core particles was determined by isopropanol chemisorption.

  abstract = {Mathematical modeling of turbulent reacting flows is and will remain a big challenge. A calculation from first principles is computationally prohibitive, and several statistical modexls have been developed to simplify the numerical simulation of turbulent flames. The problem of these approaches is that they remain models that can only be improved if information about the coupling of turbulence, chemical reaction, and molecular transport is available. Besides experimental investigations, direct numerical simulation (DNS) is one of the tools able to supply such information. One major problem of DNS is the overwhelming amount of data that is obtained from each calculation, and methods are needed that allow to extract the information that one is really interested in. It is known that in reacting flows, the chemical kinetics does not access the whole composition space, but it is confined to low-dimensional subspaces, the so-called intrinsic low-dimensional manifolds (ILDM). Thus, the fast chemical processes introduce correlations between the species concentrations. These correlations can be extracted from the DNS data. In this work, we present DNS calculations of a turbulent non-premixed hydrogen-air flame and a method that allows an analysis of the data and a determination of the local ILDMs. The results reveal interesting information on the coupling of the chemical kinetics with the turbulent processes. However the method described is not limited to this specific, example. It can be used for the analysis of DNS of other flames (premixed, other fuels) and even to analyze data obtained from experimental investigations.},

  abstract      = {Measurements of flame and soot structure for a variety of round laminar jet premixed and nonpremixed flames fueled with hydrocarbons have been analyzed to study the properties of primary soot particle nucleation. The following properties were measured along the axes of the flames as a function of distance from the burner exit: soot concentrations by deconvoluted laser extinction, soot temperatures by deconvoluted multilane emission in the visible, soot structure by thermophoretic sampling and analysis by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), concentrations of major stable gas species (N2, Ar, H2O, H2, O2, CO, CO2, CH4, C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, C3H6, C3H8 and C6H6) by isokinetic sampling and analysis using gas chromatography, concentrations of some radical species (H, OH and O) by deconvoluted Li/LiOH atomic absorption in the visible wavelength, and flow velocities by laser velocimetry. These measurements were analyzed to yield local primary soot particle nucleation rates. Based on the assumptions that poly-aromatichydrocarbon (PAH) species grow via hydrogen-abstraction/carbon addition (HACA) mechanism, soot particle surface grows via HACA mechanism, and soot precursor particles form via coagulation of large PAH species, it was found that soot particle nucleation rates can be correlated well with the hydrogen atom concentrations. Such correlation was found to be relatively independent of flame type, original hydrocarbon-fuel type, gas temperature (1400-2350 K) and pressure (0.1-8.0 atm). The results using a general approach to predict soot volume fraction evolutions along the axes by applying the correlations found in this study are compared with the experimental values.},

  abstract        = {Measurements of size-resolved particle number concentrations during the Asian Pacific Regional Aerosol Characterization Experiment (ACE-Asia) field campaign were made at the Gosan super-site, South Korea. In East Asia, dust and precipitation phenomena play a crucial role in atmospheric environment and climate studies because they are major sources and sinks of atmospheric aerosols, especially in the springtime. Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS) Aerosol Index and backward trajectories are analyzed to investigate the spatial and temporal evolution of dust storms. The size distributions between dust and non-dust periods and times with and without precipitation are compared. In order to understand the temporal evolution of the aerosol size distribution during dust and precipitation events, a simple aerosol dynamics model is employed. The model predicted and observed size distributions are compared with the measured data. The results show that the coarse mode particle number concentrations increase by a factor of 10-16 during dust events. During precipitation, however, particles in the coarse mode are scavenged by impaction mechanism. It is found that the larger particles are more efficiently scavenged. The degree of scavenged particle varies depending on the rainfall rate, raindrop size distribution and aerosol size distribution. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract        = {Metal nanoparticles have distinctly different chemical and physical properties than currently investigated oxides. Since pure metallic nanoparticles are igniting at air, carbon stabilized copper nanoparticles were used as representative material for this class. Using copper as a representative example, we compare the cytotoxicity of copper metal nanoparticles stabilized by a carbon layer to copper oxide nanoparticles using two different cell lines. Keeping the copper exposure dose constant, the two forms of copper showed a distinctly different response. Whilst copper oxide had already been reported to be highly cytotoxic, carbon-coated copper nanoparticles were much less cytotoxic and more tolerated. Measuring the two material's intra- and extracellular solubility in model buffers explained this difference on the basis of altered copper release when supplying copper metal or the corresponding oxide particles to the cells. Control experiments using pure carbon nanoparticles were used to exclude significant surface effects. Reference experiments with ionic copper solutions confirmed a similar response of cultures if exposed to copper oxide nanoparticles or ionic copper. These observations are in line with a Trojan horse-type mechanism and illustrate the dominating influence of physico-chemical parameters on the cytotoxicity of a given metal. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.},

  abstract        = {Modeling foam drainage is an important step in understanding foam stability properties. There is a two way coupling between foam drainage dynamics and bubble size evolution. The bubble size evolution is determined in the general case by two processes: ripening and coalescence. The ripening problem modeling is relatively easy and it has been extensively studied. The coalescence problem is very complex and its modeling attempts are limited. The most sophisticated studies are based on the statistics of bubble films leading to the evolution of the average bubble size. Here an alternative approach to indirect modeling of the coalescence process is attempted. Experimental results of the evolution of bubble size distribution in free draining foams are registered. Then the so called inverse population balance approach is invoked to estimate the coalescence and ripening rates leading to the experimental bubble size evolution. Several surfactant concentrations are employed to yield foams of varying stability. It is shown that the experimental bubble size distributions can be adequately described in all cases by a log-normal distribution. This simplifies vastly the inverse problem solution since approximate methods can now be used for the solution of the population balance equation. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {Modeling soot formation in turbulent nonpremixed combustion is a difficult problem. Unlike most gaseous combustion species, soot lacks a strong state relationship with the mixture fraction due to unsteady formation rates which overlap transport timescales, and strong differential diffusion between gaseous species and soot. The conditional moment closure model (CMC) has recently been applied to the problem of turbulent soot formation. A challenge in CMC modeling is the treatment of differential diffusion. Three-dimensional direct numerical simulation (DNS) of a nonpremixed ethylene jet flame with soot formation has been performed using a 19 species reduced ethylene mechanism and a four-step, three-moment, semi-empirical soot model. The DNS provides full resolution of the turbulent flow field and is used to perform a-priori analysis of a recent CMC model derived from the joint scalar PDF transport equation. Unlike other approaches, this CMC model does not require additional transport equations to treat differentially diffusing species. A budget of the terms of the CMC equation for both gaseous species and soot is presented. In particular, exact expressions for unclosed terms are compared to typical closure models for scalar dissipation, cross-dissipation, differential diffusion, and reactive source terms. The differential diffusion model for gaseous species is found to be quite accurate, while that for soot requires an additional model for the residual term.},

  abstract  = {Modeling soot formed from solid complex fuels such as coal or biomass is difficult and rare in the combustion community. Previously a detailed model was developed for soot formation depicting the soot particle size distribution using the method of moments with interpolative closure. This model is both accurate and complex. Computational expense of this model may be beyond many large-scale simulations. As a result, a simplified version of this detailed model has been de- veloped. This simplified model makes two easy assumptions to drastically reduce the complexity of modeling soot formation. First assumption is that soot particles and soot precursors within a computational domain are assumed to be mono-dispersed, meaning all particles are the same size. This reduces the number of resolved terms to model both soot precursors and soot particles to three resolved terms rather than the 10+ terms required by the previously developed model. Second as- sumption is that all particles are spherical. While the simplified model is computationally less expensive, these two assumptions come with a cost in accuracy. Presented is both the development of this simplified model along with comparative simulations where the complex and simple models are ran. From these simulations, researchers and developers can justify which model may be used in their respective systems.},

Suitablenumerical simulation tools have effectively taken centre stage for practicing fireengineers to exploit the freedoms offered under the performance-based fire engineeringapproach. In this article, we review the state-of-the-art deterministic fire models based onthe approach of field modelling utilizing the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)techniques. Special attention is also directed towards the necessity to adopt relevantmodels and the historical development in handling the combustion and soot chemistryand radiation heat transfer in fire simulations. The structure of this article consists ofthree main parts: (i) Historical development of fire models; (ii) Implementation ofrelevant combustion, radiation and soot sub-models and (iii) Possible aspects of thefuture development in fire modelling. In the first part, discussion will centre on therevelation of the complex chemo-physical behaviour of building fires and the challengesbeing faced in numerical modelling. A comprehensive review of the historicaldevelopment of fire models will then follow by the unveiling of the basic framework offield modelling technique. Based on the framework of field modelling, theoreticalconcepts and mathematical formulation of combustion, radiation and soot sub-modelsthat have been proposed within literature will be summarized in second part. As a morein-depth demonstration of the necessity and effects of these sub-models, numerical studies devoted to assess the capability of some selected sub-models will be presented inwhich predicted results have been rigorously validated against full-scale experimentaldata. These studies show that good agreement can be achieved through the present modelwith regards to the spatial temperature and velocity distributions. Finally, for the last part,limitations and assumptions taken by the models will be addressed and some suggestionsof possible direction for further fire model development are discussed. © 2009 Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

A specially designed high-pressure RF plasma reactor fitted with an indigenously built RF plasma torch converts commercially available micrometer size alumina chunks into spherical nanophase alumina in a single step under ambient quenching conditions without use of any additional quenching gas. Obtained powder contains mixed phases of α and δ-alumina as revealed by X Ray Diffraction studies. Transmission Electron Microscopy analyses exhibit very small particle size (peak at 15 nm), narrow size distribution (half width ∼24 nm), zero agglomeration, and good crystallinity. Obtained particle characteristics together with the high purity owing to inherent electrode-less feature of the RF discharge are suitable for important technological applications including fabrication of high-power ceramic laser gain media like Y3Al5O12 (YAG) from composites of Al 2O3 and Y2O3. Characteristics of the synthesized alumina are compared with that of nanoalumina synthesized in atmospheric arcs. © 1973-2012 IEEE.},

Since the exponentiation routines of typical math libraries are rather slow, their replacement with a fast approximation can greatly reduce the overall computation time. This article describes how exponentiation can be approximated by manipulating the components of a standard (IEEE-754) floating-point representation. This models the exponential function as well as a lookup table with linear interpolation, but is significantly faster and more compact. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

Models for the development of particle shape during surface growth and for particle collision diameters are described and implemented along with two models taken from other published work. Using a stochastic approach, bivariate soot particle distributions are calculated for the first time. Distributions calculated for the new models are found to be insensitive to the collision diameter model used for coagulation. The total mass of soot produced in a laminar premixed flame is found to vary by no more than 20% as the model for the geometric effects of chemical reactions on the surface of particles is changed.

Spatially resolved, two-dimensional temperature and soot volume fractions were measured simultaneously using non-linear excitation regime two-line atomic fluorescence (NTLAF) and laser-induced incandescence (LII) techniques, respectively. The soot–temperature correlation is presented and analyzed through representative images of single-shot simultaneous temperature and soot volume fraction at various heights, as well as through joint probability density functions (PDFs) of soot volume fraction (SVF) and temperature. A strong influence of temperature on SVF is found, which is consistent with current understanding of their inter-dependence. Axial and radial plots of mean SVF categorized into temperature bands of 300K are also reported. These reveal that, while the mean SVF is a function of both temperature and axial distance, the joint PDF depends only weakly on radial distance. The study highlights the value of the simultaneous measurements for understanding soot behavior in a turbulent environment and for model development and validation.},

  abstract = {Non-equilibrium effects resulting from the slow relaxation of inertial particles to statistical equilibrium with flow fluctuations in turbulence are known to have important consequences, but they are not readily incorporated into models. Here, a simple analysis of these effects predicts −2/3 power-law dependence of the particle deposition rate on Stokes number (normalized particle inertia) in the far field of a confined turbulent flow, and a weaker near-field dependence. Near-field measurements and numerical simulations exhibit this weaker dependence, as do models that are generally viewed as validated by this result, but the models fail to capture the newly identified far-field behavior due to their equilibrium assumptions. Quantification of these qualitative observations is obtained by incorporating particle response to fluid motion into ‘one-dimensional turbulence’ (ODT), a stochastic computational model of turbulence.

The present work refers to the modeling of non-ideal vapor-phase aerosol reactors, in particular to the numerical investigation on the effects of feeding nozzle arrangement, where the most significant gradients and aerosol phenomena occur. The described aerosol CFD model, which a priori assumes a log-normal particle size distribution (PSD), has been validated against both an experimental and an industrial case, and therefore it has been applied to the study of new reactor configurations. Numerical results show that traditional axial-symmetric and jet-opposed nozzle arrangements can be improved adopting a tangential geometry. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The effects of Schmidt number and Damköhler number on the evolution of the particle parameters are analyzed. The results show that nanoparticles move to the pipe center. The particle number concentration and total particle mass are distributed non-uniformly along the radial direction. In an initially monodisperse particle field, the particle clusters with various sizes will be produced because of coagulation. As time progresses, the particle cluster diameter grows from an initial value at different rates depending on the radial position. The largest particle clusters are found in the pipe center. The particle cluster number concentration and total particle mass decrease with the increase of Schmidt number in the region near the pipe center, and the particles with lower Schmidt number are of many different sizes, i.e. more polydispersity. The particle cluster diameter and geometric standard deviation increase with the increase of Damköhler number at the same radial position.

The latitudinal dependence of the SO2 oxidation mainly leads to the equator-pole contrast of the aerosol mass loading, and the meridional circulation weakens the equator-pole contrast of the mass loading through the poleward mass transport. The equator-pole contrast of the aerosol number concentration is enhanced by the meridional circulation in the middle atmosphere.

This formulation is used to investigate variable-density effects in planar mixing layers. Computed results are compared to direct numerical simulations of temporally developing mixing layers and to measurements performed in spatially developing mixing layers. Dependencies of mean flow structure and fluctuation statistics on the free-stream density ratio s are examined, including s values beyond the range of previous experimental and computational studies. For temporally developing mixing layers, the previously noted decrease of the layer growth rate as s deviates from unity is reproduced. For spatially developing mixing layers, dependence on s is sensitive to whether the high-speed or the low-speed stream is denser; by convention, the latter case corresponds to s 1. Experimental results indicating that layer growth is an increasing function of s have previously been interpreted on the basis of models that imply the continuation of this monotonic trend for all s. ODT reproduces the observed trend within the experimentally accessible range, but predicts a reversal of the trend slightly beyond that range and a subsequent decrease of the growth rate as s increases. This and related results suggest a closer analogy between the behaviors of temporally and spatially developing mixing layers than has previously been recognized. An experimental test of the predicted trend reversal in spatially developing mixing layers is proposed.},

  abstract        = {Over the last two decades, our understanding of soot formation has evolved from an empirical, phenomenological description to an age of quantitative modeling for at least small fuel compounds. In this paper, we review the current state of knowledge of the fundamental sooting processes, including the chemistry of soot precursors, particle nucleation and mass/size growth. The discussion shows that though much progress has been made, critical gaps remain in many areas of our knowledge. We propose the roles of certain aromatic radicals resulting from localized π electron structures in particle nucleation and subsequent mass growth. The existence of these free radicals provides a rational explanation for the strong binding forces needed for forming initial clusters of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. They may also explain a range of currently unexplained sooting phenomena, including the large amount of aliphatics observed in nascent soot formed in laminar premixed flames and the mass growth of soot in the absence of gas-phase H atoms. While the above suggestions are inspired, to an extent, by recent theoretical findings from the materials research community, this paper also demonstrates that the knowledge garnered through our longstanding interest in soot formation may well be carried over to flame synthesis of functional nanomaterials for clean and renewable energy applications. In particular, work on flame-synthesized thin films of nanocrystalline titania illustrates how our combustion knowledge might be useful for developing advanced yet inexpensive thin-film solar cells and chemical sensors for detecting gaseous air pollutants. © 2010 Published by Elsevier Inc. on behalf of The Combustion Institute.

  abstract      = {Particle number concentrations and size distributions were measured near a heated wafer in a low pressure, SiH4:O2:He chemical vapor deposition reactor. The wafer was heated to 450°C and the pressure was varied from 650-3250 Pa. The measurements were compared with 2D numerical simulations of particle formation, growth, and transport. A key feature of the model is that pressure-dependent cluster sticking coefficients are needed to explain the pressure-dependence of the aerosol size distribution. The pressure dependence of the calculated and measured aerosol size distributions are in good agreement. At a height of 2 cm above the wafer and at a reactor pressure, P, of 650 Pa, the simulated particle concentration is 104 [No./cm3], increasing to about 108 [No./cm3] at 1950 Pa, indicating that particle nucleation rates depend on approximately P9. Particle formation rates were shown to become negligible below about P = 650 Pa. At P = 2600 Pa the size distribution was unimodal at a height of 2 cm above the wafer and became trimodal at a height of 7 cm above the wafer. This trimodal size distribution occurs because particle nucleation occurs both near the center of the wafer as well as near the edge of the wafer, where the temperature gradients are steep.},

  abstract        = {Particles produced from a gas-saturated solution process (PGSS) in a capillary nozzle are assumed to be in steady, 1-D, inviscid, and two-phase equilibrium homogenous flow. Fluid dynamic equations including mass, momentum and energy conservations are established to describe the mixture's pressure, temperature, velocity and density change along the nozzle. The aerosol dynamic equation for crystallization of the natural lipid hydrogenated palm oil (HPO) in the pseudo-single phase is proposed considering that homogenous nucleation, condensation, and coagulation occur simultaneously along the nozzle. Using the Peng-Robinson equation of state for the fluid properties and phase equilibrium, the coupled model equations are numerically solved to describe the PGSS process for the CO2/HPO system. Axial profiles for the concentration of CO2 in HPO, total pressure, temperature, velocities and densities of the two phases, particle size, and particle size distribution inside the nozzle have been calculated. The model also shows that HPO particles produced by rapid expansion of supercritical solutions (RESS) are about 3.5 % (in mass) of the total solid production at 18 MPa and 359 K and, therefore, can be neglected. © 2004 Elsevier B.V.

The lower volatile content of petroleum coke and the lower surface area of the char relative to coal make petroleum coke more difficult to ignite than coal and require longer burnout times relative to coal. Green cokes generally have volatile matter in the range of 8-10%, whereas calcined cokes have on the order of 1% volatile matter. This paper presents information on petroleum coke combustion kinetics that was obtained from combustion of petroleum coke char samples under well-controlled conditions. Green petroleum coke reactivity was higher than that of calcined coke, but lower than coal. Measured reactivities were used to model the combustion of petroleum coke and to explore the effects of particle size and temperature on burnout time.},

Simulated Dutch natural gas was used as the fuel to produce a flame closely matching those in which a wide range of previous investigations, both experimental and modelling, have been performed. The LII method was calibrated using a Santoro-style burner with ethylene as the fuel. Instantaneous and time-averaged data of the axial and radial soot volume fraction distributions of the flame are presented here along with the Probability Density Functions (PDFs) and intermittency. The PDFs were found to be well-characterised by a single exponential distribution function. The distribution of soot was found to be highly intermittent, with intermittency typically exceeding 97%, which increases measurement uncertainty. The instantaneous values of volume fraction are everywhere less than the values in strained laminar flames. This is consistent with the soot being found locally in strained flame sheets that are convected and distorted by the flow.},

  abstract        = {Population balance equations (PBE) for a number density function (NDF) arise in many applications of aerosol technology. Thus, there has been considerable interest in the development of numerical methods to find solutions to PBE, especially in the context of spatially inhomogeneous systems where moment realizability becomes a significant issue. Quadrature-based moment methods (QBMM) are an important class of methods for which the accuracy of the solution can be improved in a controlled manner by increasing the number of quadrature nodes. However, when a large number of nodes is required to achieve the desired accuracy, the moment-inversion problem can become ill-conditioned. Moreover, oftentimes pointwise values of the NDF are required, but are unavailable with existing QBMM. In this work, a new generation of QBMM is introduced that provides an explicit form for the NDF. This extended quadrature method of moments (EQMOM) approximates the NDF by a sum of non-negative weight functions, which allows unclosed source terms to be computed with great accuracy by increasing the number of quadrature nodes independent of the number of transported moments. Here, we use EQMOM to solve a spatially homogeneous PBE with aggregation, breakage, condensation, and evaporation terms, and compare the results with analytical solutions whenever possible. However, by employing realizable finite-volume methods, the extension of EQMOM to spatially inhomogeneous systems is straightforward. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

The effects of process conditions, mixing, turbulence and chemical additives on coagulation- and condensation-controlled gas-to-powder conversion processes are elucidated. Strategies for control of average particle size, polydispersity and degree of agglomeration are outlined. Coagulation-controlled processes usually result in agglomerate powders of solid primary particles, while condensation-controlled processes result in nonagglomerate powders. In coagulation-controlled processes, the narrowest possible size distribution is set by the self-preserving limit for complete coalescence, σg≈1.45. A possible way of further narrowing this distribution is by electrical charging of the aerosol. The size distribution broadens by shear-induced (turbulent) coagulation and by broad residence time distributions caused by mixing or gas recirculation. Sintering makes the primary particle size distribution narrower than that of the parent agglomerates. In principle, condensation-controlled processes may result in narrower size distributions than coagulation-controlled ones. Here, high reaction rates and low particle surface energies favor narrow size distributions. © 1995.},

After using Monte Carlo (MC) method to simulate the evolution of aerosol dynamics along particles trajectories, the particles size distributions are obtained, which are unavailable in mostly used methods of moments. Design/methodology/approach: Nucleation and growth of dibutyl phthalate (DBP) particles are simulated using the quadrature method of moments in a planar mixing layer, where a fast hot stream with DBP vapor is mixing with a slow cool stream without vapor. Trajectories of aerosol particles are recorded. MC method is used to simulate the aerosol evolution along trajectories. Findings: Investigation on aerosol evolution along the trajectories prompts to classify these trajectories into three groups: first, trajectories away from the active nucleation zone; second, trajectories starting from the active nucleation zone; and third, trajectories crossing over the active nucleation zone. Particle size distributions (psds) along selected representative trajectories are investigated. The psd evolution exhibits interesting behavior due to the synthetic effects of nucleation and condensation. Condensation growth tends to narrow down the psd, and form a sharp front on the side of big particle size. Nucleation is able to broaden the psd through generating the smallest particles. The duration and strength of nucleation have significant effect on the shape of psd. Originality/value: As far as the authors knowledge, it is the first simulation of aerosol evolution that takes a Lagrangian point of view, and uses MC simulation along particles trajectories to provide the particles size distribution.},

Simulation results were compared with predictions of the Conditional Moment Closure model. This model was found to give good results for all quantities of interest when the conditionally averaged scalar dissipation was used in the prediction.

With the former, mass spectra were obtained as described in the literature and characterized through a series of signal groups, one for each C-number and extending to about m/z 1000, assigned as a PAH series. When the ArF laser was used the same series was observed with a somewhat higher sensitivity. In addition, a new series was observed overlaid on the PAH series and starting at about m/z 680. The new series exhibited abundant ions and it completely dominated the spectrum beyond m/z 1000. This series was identified as being the spectrum of soot precursor particles. Through measurement of the ionization order it was concluded that at least two photons are needed for ionization of PAHs whereas the particles need only one photon. Consequently, they can be measured with high sensitivity when an ArF laser is used as the radiation source. Furthermore, the discrimination of soot precursor molecules and soot precursor particles becomes possible through photoionization and this enables an improved understanding of the mass spectra. This should allow a particle growth mechanism to be deduced in the near future. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

The ODT-based closure approach is formulated to predict scalar statistics coupled with the Reynolds-averaged Navier–Stokes (RANS) approach. Comparison with experimental correlations of reactive scalars with the two conditioning variables show that double conditioning may be adequate to prescribe scalar statistics in the jet diffusion flames. The results also show that the ODT model may be used to construct these statistics. The 2D conditioning table is coupled with RANS to compute Sandia flames D, E, and F, which exhibit increasing rates of extinction followed by reignition as the Reynolds numbers are increased. The coupling also requires the transport of the means and variances of the mixture fraction and temperature. Closure terms in the temperature mean and variance equations are obtained by using the 2D table for reaction source terms and by assuming a presumed PDF shape for the temperature PDF. Comparisons show adequate predictions of axial and radial profiles of the mixture fraction, the streamwise velocity, and the reactive scalars for flames D and E and mixed results for flame F. Nonetheless, qualitative trends of increasing the jet Reynolds numbers resulting in more pronounced extinctions are obtained with the RANS-ODT approach. The discrepancy between computation and experiment may be attributed primarily to the closure for the temperature and its variance and to the presumed PDF shape for the temperature.},

The formation of PAH and their secondary oxidation in flames of aliphatic and aromatic fuels is reported and discussed. Aromatics with side chains seem to play an important role for the formation of PAH both in the oxidation zone and in the burned gas. Remarkable similarities for the mass growth of soot and its time and temperature dependence have been found for a large number of fuels. Mass growth is interpreted in terms of soot surface reactions, mainly with acetylene. The reason for the decrease in surface reactivity is still not understood. Simultaneous oxidation of soot in the secondary oxidation zone, early recognized by Millikan,26 might explain the negative temperature dependence of the amount of soot formed. The formation of large ions occurs in a secondary ionization zone of sooting flames. There are striking differences in flames of aliphatic and aromatic fuel. The mechanism of ionization of large molecules and small soot particles still presents a problem. The role of charged particles in soot formation is discussed.},

In the absence of an initial aerosol, two analytical expressions are obtained for the number of particles produced in such bursts, valid for high and low rates of vapour production, respectively. These results compare favourably with calculations made using a detailed numerical code, using the homogeneous nucleation of sulphuric acid/water droplets as an illustration. Then we consider barrierless nucleation, where clusters are always stable against evaporation, which is relevant to the production of ammonium sulphate particles in the atmosphere. We go on to consider conditions where existing aerosol can affect the production of particles, and also consider slower bursts where the time dependence of the vapour production rate, and not condensation on the nucleated aerosol, cuts off nucleation.},

The agreement between the different data sets is generally good, and most of the observed deviations are within experimental uncertainties. The remaining discrepancies are discussed.

Simulations were performed in the environment of a 10-bar laminar premixed flame of ethylene. The Monte Carlo algorithm begins in the particle inception zone and constructs soot particles via ensemble-averaged collisions between small spheres and deposition of gaseous species on the sphere surfaces. Simulations were conducted using three scenarios. Scenario 1 forces all spheres to grow at a uniform rate, whereas scenario 2 only permits them to grow once they have collided and stuck to each other. Results from 1 and 2 were compared to a reference, labeled scenario 0, which simulates aggregation in the absence of surface growth. The simulations demonstrate that aggregation with sufficiently small spherical particles in the presence of surface growth leads to a spheroidal shape. The results show that the spheroidal shape of particles is attributed to rapid surface growth and intense particle nucleation. In addition, particle shape may also be affected by rearrangement of the internal structure of colliding aromatic clusters.},

  abstract        = {Soot formation in five laminar premixed ethylene flames was studied computationally in order to investigate the ability of a sectional model to reproduce measured soot particle size distributions (PSDs). The flames were modelled using a burner-stabilised stagnation flow configuration due to the influence of the sampling probe. In the vicinity of the probe, the residence time is relatively long and the temperature reduced. It was found that under such conditions the coagulation efficiency for small (<10 nm) particles becomes important due to the combination of a relatively low nucleation rate with a significant collision frequency. In previous studies, the impact of the probe was only accounted for by shifting the position of the measured PSDs. A model for the collision efficiency was introduced with a particle size dependent interpolation between a lower limit, based on the Lennard-Jones potential, and an upper limit, based on collision stabilisation caused by the surrounding gas. The developed model is consistent with a low collision efficiency for PAH coagulation and explains the measured high number densities of small particles. The size of particles affected by a reduced collision efficiency were found to decrease with increasing flame temperature. The effect is consistent with temperature dependent internal carbonisation processes changing the polarisability of particles leading to a strengthening of attractive forces and enhanced collisional stabilisation. The calculated PSDs were found to be in reasonable agreement with measurements. © 2012 The Combustion Institute.},

It was extended to account for the formation of aggregates, which are clusters of primary particles. Experimental results for temperatureand soot-related quantities are compared to simulations with a special emphasis on the effect of soot aggregation. Aggregate formation is shown to be important for predicting soot particle sizes and optical properties, but it does not significantly influence soot-generating processes and the overall flame structure. We also show that thermal diffusive processes must be considered for the gas-phase modeling, especially for the species (Soret effect) as it has an impact on the pyrolysis zone of the diffusion flame and consequently on the soot concentration.},

The fuels studied were heptane, toluene and their iso-volumetric mixture (H50T50), given their relevance as surrogate fuels. Extinction measurements were used to calculate the soot volume fraction, Fv, and determine the optical band gap (OBG) as a function of flame position. The OBG was derived from the near-edge absorption feature using Tauc/Davis-Mott analysis. A direct band gap (r = 0.5) was selected for this analysis assuming that the electronic properties of soot are dominated by the molecular structure of the PAHs. For the HRTEM analysis, soot samples were collected at different locations in the flame using thermophoretic sampling and a fast-insertion technique. The images were then analyzed using a 'lattice-fringe' algorithm, to determine important parameters such as the fringe length. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) sizes were estimated from conjugation lengths obtained from OBG measurements and fringe lengths from HRTEM measurements. Across all studied flames, the peak Fv ranged from 3.4 ppm in the heptane flame to 17.6 ppm in the toluene flame. Despite this wide range, the average OBG across the different flames only varied from 2.05 eV in the H50T50 to 2.10 eV in the toluene flames, which is consistent with molecule lengths of between 0.96 nm and 0.99 nm. Lattice fringe analysis yielded slightly lower average fringe lengths between 0.91 and 0.99 nm throughout the different flames. Results of in-situ and ex-situ characterization of soot suggests that flames of different fuel nature and sooting stage undergo the transition from chemical to physical growth at a similar size, about the size of circumpyrene. © 2015 The Combustion Institute.},

  abstract  = {Soot particles formed in flames and practical combustion devices can be described as fractal-like aggregates comprised of spheroidal primary particles. The size of primary particles is known to exceed that of particles incepted from the gas phase. It is therefore often argued that particle aggregation is preceded by a period of coalescent growth.1 It has been argued that transition from coalescent to aggregate growth is a result of simultaneous coagulation and surface growth.2 Mitchell and Frenklach3,4 investigated the mechanism of transition from coalescent to aggregate growth by calculating trajectories of individual collector particles using a dynamic Monte-Carlo method, where collector particles allowed to grow through collisions with the surrounding monodispersed candidate particles and simultaneous surface growth. These authors concluded that the morphology of aggregating particles is intimately related to both the surface deposition and particle nucleation rates. Extending this study, Balthasar and Frenklach5 conducted similar simulations using a realistic size distribution for selecting candidate particles. The simulation results provided further support to the notion that particle nucleation and the presence of small particles influence the morphology of primary particles and the location of transition. In the both studies, however, aggregate-aggregate formation was not taken into account. While the aggregation kinetics was recently modeled using a method of moments,6 the morphology of the forming aggregates could not be examined with this approach. In the present study, we extend the Monte-Carlo method to enable numerical simulations of the entire particle ensemble with aggregate-aggregate collisions included. The new approach is applied to the formation of soot particles in laminar premixed flames.},

  abstract = {Soot surface oxidation was studied experimentally in laminar hydrocarbon/air diffusion flames at atmospheric pressure. Measurements were carried out along the axes of round fuel jets burning in co-flowing dry air considering acetylene-nitrogen, ethylene, propylene-nitrogen, propane and acetylene-benzene-nitrogen in the fuel stream. Measurements were limited to the initial stages of soot oxidation (carbon consumption less than 70%) where soot oxidation occurs at the surface of primary soot particles. The following properties were measured as a function of distance above the burner exit: soot concentrations by deconvoluted laser extinction, soot temperatures by deconvoluted multiline emission, soot structure by thermophoretic sampling and analysis using Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM), concentrations of major stable gas species (N2, H2O, H2, O2, CO, CO2, CH4, C2H2, C2H4, C2H6, C3H6, C3H8, and C6H6) by sampling and gas chromatography, concentrations of some radical species (H, OH, O) by deconvoluted Li/LiOH atomic absorption and flow velocities by laser velocimetry. For present test conditions, it was found that soot surface oxidation rates were not affected by fuel type, that direct rates of soot surface oxidation by O2 estimated from Nagle and Strickland-Constable (1962) were small compared to observed soot surface oxidation rates because soot surface oxidation was completed near the flame sheet where O2 concentrations were less than 3% by volume, and that soot surface oxidation rates were described by the OH soot surface oxidation mechanism with a collision efficiency of 0.14 and an uncertainty (95% confidence) of ±0.04 when allowing for direct soot surface oxidation by O2, which is in reasonably good agreement with earlier observations of soot surface oxidation rates in both premixed and diffusion flames at atmospheric pressure.},

The emphasis of the study was to follow the evolution of the \{PSDF\} from the onset of particle inception to particle mass growth. At the onset of soot inception, the \{PSDF\} was found to follow a power-law dependence on particle diameter. The \{PSDF\} becomes bimodal at larger height above the burner surface, and remains bimodal throughout the flame. Numerical simulation using a kinetic model proposed previously and a stochastic approach to solve aerosol dynamics equations again showed a bimodal PSDF. Further analysis revealed that bimodality is intrinsic to an aerosol process involving particle-particle coagulation and particle nucleation dominated by monomer dimerization. },

The solution to the governing equations are complicated due to the high-dimensional spaces and the presence of randomness. In this paper we present libMoM ( http://libmom.sourceforge.net ), a software library to solve various types of Stochastic Differential Equations (SDE) as well as estimate statistical distributions from the moments. The library provides a suite of tools to solve various SDEs using the method of moments (MoM) as well as estimate statistical distributions from the moments using moment matching algorithms. For a large class of problems, MoM provide efficient solutions compared with other stochastic simulation techniques such as Monte Carlo (MC). In the physical sciences, the moments of the distribution are usually the primary quantities of interest. The library enables the solution of moment equations derived from a variety of SDEs, with closure using non-standard Gaussian quadrature. In engineering risk assessment and decision making, statistical distributions are required. The library implements tools for fitting the Generalized Lambda Distribution (GLD) with the given moments. The objectives of this paper are (1) to briefly outline the theory behind moment methods for solving SDEs/estimation of statistical distributions; (2) describe the organization of the software and user interfaces; (3) discuss use of standard software engineering tools for regression testing, aid collaboration, distribution and further development. A number of representative examples of the use of libMoM in various engineering applications are presented and future areas of research are discussed. © 2011 Springer-Verlag London Limited.},

In this work, we focus on numerical simulation of the process, emphasizing mixing modeling. Different mixing devices characterized by different nozzles are analyzed, to get an insight into mixing dynamics and its influence on the final particle size distribution.

The interaction between fluid dynamics and physicochemical processes (i.e., nucleation, particle growth, and coagulation) leads to an axial variation of bulk properties (species concentration and particle size distribution) and of ionic and particulate deposition rates at the pipe wall. To simulate this complicated system, very simple hydrodynamics (plug flow) is combined with rather comprehensive modeling of physicochemical phenomena. Considerable effort is devoted to the optimization of computational requirements, thus developing a numerical algorithm efficient and flexible enough to cope with even more demanding future tasks such as the inclusion of mixing. The performance of the model is examined using, as a test case, the precipitation of a sparingly soluble salt under conditions typical for geothermal installations. An extensive study of the effects of the initial saturation ratio and of the tendency for particle coagulation on the deposition rate and on the particle size distribution along the pipe is carried out.},

  abstract        = {Surprisingly, there is still no rational yet practical method to reliably predict absolute 'primary' nanospherule sizes and, hence, specific surface areas, in gas phase flame nanoparticle synthesis. The present paper summarizes our approach to this important problem, using a plausible and tractable coagulation-coalescence (two-rate process) model, but with an important modification to the rate of nanoparticle coalescence. The Smoluchowski equation is used to describe the particle Brownian coagulation rate process (free-molecule regime), together with the assumption that the particle population follows a self-preserving size distribution. The decisive coalescence process, driven by the minimization of surface energy of the coalescing nanoparticles, is presumed to occur via the mechanism of surface diffusion. However, a curvature-dependent energy barrier for surface-diffusion is proposed, taking into account the extended 'surface-melting' behavior of nanoparticles. This is shown here to have the effect of accelerating the coalescence rate of touching nanoparticles, leading to absolute sizes (at the predicted onset of aggregate formation) in encouraging agreement with available experiments. It was found that the coalescence rate, especially with a curvature-augmented surface diffusivity, is far more sensitive to particle size than is the Brownian coagulation rate. As a result, when cast in terms of characteristic process times, a distinct crossover generally exists, allowing the determination of observed 'primary' spherule sizes within larger aggregates. This approach is successfully applied here to several published synthesis examples of vapor-derived nanosized alumina and titania. Its broader implications for nanoparticle synthesis in non-isothermal reactors, including our own counterflow diffusion flame reactor, are also briefly summarized.},

(1992). The large eddy simulation uses the Euler–Lagrange framework for two-phase flows and relatively simple sub-models for the particle heat-up, devolatilisation, char combustion and radiation governing the pulverised coal combustion process are employed. The simulations yield improved predictions of the velocity statistics in the quarl region and result in a favourable agreement of the mean species profiles along the burner centreline compared with the measurements, while some temperature underprediction can be observed. Furthermore, the transient Euler–Lagrange approach allows for a cross-comparison of the velocity and scalar statistics between the two phases and the comparison of the mean axial velocity and temperature shows the two phases to be near thermal and kinetic equilibrium along the burner axis. Individual particle time histories, which are crucial for the coal combustion sub-processes and overall flame stabilisation, are analysed. It is found that there is a lack of oxygen in the inner quarl region leading to a decreased volatile burning rate, which could however, be related to the simplified EBU turbulence–chemistry interaction model.},

Due to their low production rate and limited scalability, these processes are of minor technical relevance in manufacturing commercial quantities of nanoparticles. The most common and by far the most important industrial process is flame hydrolysis. In this process, a gaseous mixture of a metal chloride precursor, hydrogen and air is introduced in a closed and continuously operated flame reactor. The general mechanism of formation and growth of particles (e.g. silica) occurring in the flame is dominated by nucleation, coalescence (sintering) and coagulation (collision) of primary particles forming aggregated structures. The term 'aggregate' describes clusters of particles held together by strong chemical bonds. Agglomerates, however, are defined as loose accumulations of particles held together by hydrogen bonds for example. Although, a variety of physico-chemical methods exist to characterise pyrogenic oxides, the most important ones are analysis of the specific surface area by the so-called BET method, determination of the aggregate size by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and characterisation of the phase composition by means of X-ray analysis. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The method of moments is used to account for coagulation and agglomeration in the coalescent and fractal aggregate limits. The soot model is coupled with a transported PDF approach closed at the joint-scalar level to directly account for interactions between turbulence, and the solid and gas phase chemistry. The latter is represented by a systematically reduced reaction mechanism for ethylene featuring 144 reactions, 15 solved and 14 steady-state species. Radiation from soot and gas phase species is accounted for through the RADCAL method and the inclusion of enthalpy into the joint-scalar PDF.

  abstract      = {The accuracy of the moment method of log-normal size distribution for aerosol coagulation problem was investigated. The constant collision kernel coagulation problem was solved by the moment method as well as a very accurate numerical method (Landgrebe and Pratsinis, 1990) for the purpose. Approximate analytical solutions to the problem by different choices of moments were obtained and compared with the result of the accurate numerical model. During the analysis, solutions to the moments of the size distribution were obtained in exact form and it was discussed that the solutions can be used as a standard reference for ensuring the accuracy of any new numerical schemes for solving the coagulation equation. The time evolution of the particle size distribution was obtained by representing the size distribution with a log-normal size distribution function. Depending on the choice for three moments during the analysis, different solutions to the size distribution parameters were obtained. Three choices for moments were compared as an example. The use of the 0th, 11st and 2nd moments which has been conventionally used was proven to be most accurate for various polydispersity cases by comparing with a numerical result and is recommended to be used for future studies. © 2000, Taylor &amp; Francis Group, LLC.

  abstract = {The advancement of our basic understanding of turbulent combustion processes and the development of physics-based predictive tools for design and optimization of the next generation of combustion devices are strategic areas of research for the development of a secure, environmentally sound energy infrastructure. In direct numerical simulation (DNS) approaches, all scales of the reacting flow problem are resolved. However, because of the magnitude of this task, DNS of practical high Reynolds number turbulent hydrocarbon flames is out of reach of even terascale computing. For the foreseeable future, the approach to this complex multi-scale problem is to employ distinct but synergistic approaches to tackle smaller sub-ranges of the complete problem, which then require models for the small scale interactions. With full access to the spatially and temporally resolved fields, DNS can play a major role in the development of these models and in the development of fundamental understanding of the micro-physics of turbulence-chemistry interactions. Two examples, from simulations performed at terascale Office of Science computing facilities, are presented to illustrate the role of DNS in delivering new insights to advance the predictive capability of models. Results are presented from new three-dimensional DNS with detailed chemistry of turbulent non-premixed jet flames, revealing the differences between mixing of passive and reacting scalars, and determining an optimal lower dimensional representation of the full thermochemical state space.},

  abstract        = {The asymptotic size distribution of fractal particles undergoing Brownian and simultaneous shear-induced coagulation has not been investigated. We have addressed this issue by establishing and solving ordinary integro-differential coagulation equations. The self-preserving distribution (SPSD) requires a shear rate decreasing with time according to a formula, which we report, for various fractal dimensions. Under this condition, it is the Peclet number of primary particles that controls the self-preservative characteristics of coagulating aggregates. The size distribution of fractal aggregates at low Peclet numbers of primary particles was determined to be self-preserving. The SPSDs were calculated for aggregates of various fractal dimensions. An upper limit of the Peclet number exists where the SPSD could be obtained. This upper limit decreases with decreasing fractal dimension: from 1.1 for the fractal dimension of 3 to 0.14 for the fractal dimension of 1.8. The Peclet number of particles with the mean volume hydrodynamic radius is a constant during the coagulation process, and is proportional to the Peclet number of primary particles. As the Peclet number increases, the SPSDs will broaden, and the peak value will also increases and drifts to the left. The SPSD is close to a lognormal distribution. This represents a theoretical foundation for the size distribution evolution of coagulating fractal aggregates in flow fields and for the lognormal size distribution assumption of atmospheric aerosols. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

This type of kernel renders the handling of the breakage equation by conventional techniques very difficult, necessitating alternative problem solving approaches. Exploiting the structure of the erosion-breakage kernel, a new particle erosion equation is derived as the first-order term of a formal perturbation expansion with respect to kernel parameters. However, even this new equation is very difficult to treat because of the multimodality of its solution associated with the developing generations of fragments. In order to overcome this difficulty, the problem is decomposed into a system of equations for the size distribution of the generations of fragments which admits unimodal solutions. The properties and the methods of solution (analytical, method of moments, etc) are studied extensively. Using solution techniques developed in this paper, results are reported for some simple cases, revealing a very interesting and rather unusual structure of the solutions of the erosion-breakage equation.},

  abstract        = {The burner stabilized stagnation flame technique coupled with micro-orifice probe sampling and mobility sizing has evolved into a useful tool for examining the evolution of the particle size distribution of nascent soot in laminar premixed flames. Several key aspects of this technique are examined through a multi-university collaborative study that involves both experimental measurement and computational modeling. Key issues examined include (a) data reproducibility and facility effects using four burners of different sizes and makers over three different facilities, (b) the mobility diameter and particle mass relationship, and (c) the degree to which the finite orifice flow rate affects the validity of the boundary condition in a pseudo one dimensional stagnation flow flame formulation. The results indicate that different burners across facilities yield nearly identical results after special attention is paid to a range of experimental details, including a proper selection of the sample dilution ratio and quantification of the experimental flame boundary conditions. The mobility size and mass relationship probed by tandem mass and mobility measurement shows that nascent soot with mobility diameter as small as 15 nm can deviate drastically from the spherical shape. Various non-spherical morphology models using a mass density value of 1.5 g/cm3 can reconcile this discrepancy in nascent soot mass. Lastly, two-dimensional axisymmetric simulations of the experimental flame with and without the sample orifice flow reveal several problems of the pseudo one-dimensional stagnation flow flame approximation. The impact of the orifice flow on the flame and soot sampled, although small, is not negligible. Specific suggestions are provided as to how to treat the non-ideality of the experimental setup in experiment and model comparisons. © 2015 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc.

  abstract = {The burning modes (premixed vs. diffusion burning) in autoigniting non-homogeneous mixtures of hydrogen in heated air are studied using direct numerical simulations (DNS). The simulations show that high-temperature combustion follows an initial autoignition stage in fuel-lean, low-dissipation kernels. These kernels propagate initially as lean premixed fronts. As they expand into richer mixtures, diffusion flames develop in the wake of rich premixed flames along stoichiometric isocontours. These flames are initially stabilized by diffusion of radicals (H) and excess fuel from the rich premixed flames' side against excess radicals (O and OH) and oxidizer from the earlier passage of lean premixed fronts. In time, diffusion flames detach from the rich premixed flames, and their burning intensity is reduced accordingly. Triple flames also form at the interfaces of the rich and lean premixed flames with the stoichiometric mixture isocontours. However, their contribution to the stabilization and burning intensity of the diffusion branches is insignificant. Analysis of the contribution of lean and rich premixed flames and that of the diffusion flames to the volumetric heat release show that the dominant contribution is attributed mainly to the premixed flames: while the dominant contribution to NO formation is attributed to diffusion flames. The results also show that the relative contribution of the different burning modes is strongly dependent on the mixture distribution and the scalar dissipation rate field. We believe that these parameters affect the diffusion flames' structures and their rates of detachment from the rich premixed flames.},

The influence of the turbulence–radiation interaction (TRI) has been studied. In the \{TRI\} modeling, the radiative properties of the assumed homogeneous turbulent structures are randomly obtained from a multidimensional probability density function (PDF) of the reaction progress variable, of the mixture ratio and of the soot volume fraction. This joint \{PDF\} is obtained from an Eulerian–Lagrangian turbulent combustion model and the sizes of the turbulent structures are directly derived from a k–ϵ model. In the considered flame, the \{TRI\} effect is an increase of the radiative heat loss by about 30%. The radiative heat loss becomes almost equal to one-third of the chemical heat release. Soot particles play the most important role in the global radiative heat loss but the influence of gaseous species like \{CO2\} and \{H2O\} can be important in the local energy balance. },

  abstract = {The chemical reaction pathways to soot were investigated by experimenting with detailed kinetic models of soot formation under the conditions used in shock-tube pyrolysis experiments. The analyses of the computational results revealed a single dominant route for the main soot mass growth. Fused polycyclic aromatics play a particularly important role: their formation reactions are essentially irreversible and have the effect of “pulling” chains of reversible reactions. Hydrogen atoms reactivate aromatic molecules to radicals by abstraction reactions. The main bottleneck appears at the formation of the first aromatic ring. The model explains the time scale of soot formation and soot yields obtained in shock-tube pyrolysis of acetylene and also is in accord with product distributions observed in flames.},

The moment equations for coagulation in the entire size regime are achieved by the harmonic mean solution and the Dahneke's solution.

The strainrate formula for the reaction rate is obtained from the analytical solution for a flame in a laminar, plane stagnation point flow. Here, the formula's effectiveness is examined by comparisons with data from a direct numerical simulation (DNS) of a round jetlike flow that undergoes transition to turbulence. Significant differences due to general flow features can be understood qualitatively: Model predictions are good in the braids between vortex rings, which are present in the near field of round jets, as the strain rate is extensional and reaction surfaces are isolated. In several other regions, the strain rate is compressive or flame surfaces are folded close together. There, the predictions are poor as the local flow no longer resembles the model flow. Quantitative comparisons showed some discrepancies. A modified, consistent application of the strain-rate solution did not show significant changes in the prediction of mean reaction rate distributions.},

The momentum, heat and mass transfer, binary homogeneous nucleation, Brownian coagulation, Brownian and turbulent diffusion, condensation and thermophoresis are simultaneously taken into account. Good agreements between the experimental and simulated results with respect to the pollutant dispersion are obtained. Compared to other published methods, the present TEMOM requires the least computational time with much accuracy for predicting nanoparticle dynamics. The instantaneous results show that large eddies dominate the evolution of particulate dynamics as exhaust develops, while binary homogeneous sulfuric-water nucleation mainly appears at the interface between the exhaust and ambient cool gases. The increasing of fuel sulfur content and relative humidity or the decreasing of environment temperature leads to an increase in particulate product rate, while volume-averaged particle diameter increases with increasing fuel sulfur content and environment temperature. The variation of geometric standard deviation suggests the nucleated particles eventually approach the asymptotic distribution in the dilution atmosphere, and this distribution is independent of the fuel sulfur content. The variance of upstream turbulence intensity significantly affects the evolution of particulate matters inside the plume. © 2009 World Scientific Publishing Company.},

The NO formation is estimated by solving the Eulerian particle transport equations in a postprocessing mode. Two test problems are considered: CH4/H2/N2 jet flame and CH4/H2 stabilised bluff body flame. The temperature and species profiles are well captured by the flamelet model. Two different chemical mechanisms (GRI 2.11 and 3.0) give nearly identical results for temperature and species except NO. The GRI 3.0 gives significantly higher NO levels compared to the GRI 2.11. This is mainly attributed to the difference in NO formation by the prompt mechanism. The NO formation is sensitive to the number of flamelet particles. The NO levels for two test flames do not change when the flamelet particle number exceeds six.},

  abstract  = {The conditional-moment closure (CMC) equation for the evolution of a large Lewis number scalar, soot, is derived starting from the joint probability density function (pdf) equation for the gas-phase mixture fraction, ξg, and the soot mass fraction, Y$_s$. Unlike previous approaches starting with the joint pdf, the residual terms that result from the typical closure models were retained. A new formulation of the one-dimensional turbulence (ODT) model suitable for spatially evolving flows with buoyant acceleration and radiative transport in participating media was employed to carry out simulations of a prototypical ethene fire. The resulting ODT evolution of ξg and Ys was used to assess the significance of various terms in the CMC equation including the residual correlations. The terms involving differential diffusion are found to be important along with the soot source terms and the large-scale evolution of both ξg and Ys. Of particular importance in the regions in mixture-fraction space around the soot production and consumption is a residual term, not previously identified, related to the correlation between the differential diffusion and Ys. This term results in a diffusion-like behavior of Ys in the mixture fraction coordinate that has an apparent Lewis number near unity. In scenarios where the large Lewis number component is a non-negligible component of the mixture fraction (i.e., large soot loading), it is found easier to employ a mixture fraction neglecting this component. Such a mixture-fraction variable has a chemical source term, but this appears easier to model than the differential diffusion and dissipation terms that result when the large Lewis number component is retained in the mixture-fraction definition.},

The types and strength of C−H bonds in the peripheries of PAH molecules and in the surfaces of carbonaceous solids are considered, and radical-site concentrations are computed assuming equilibration of hydrogen abstraction by H atom and hydrogen addition by H2. Computed populations of radical sites are consistent with observed trends in radical/parent concentration ratios measured in flames. Calculated extents of radical formation in PAH molecules and in the surfaces of carbonaceous solids in combustion are substantial, e.g., ≈0.1 to 0.3 radical sites per original C−H bond. For large PAH of interest as soot precursors, the estimated average number of radical sites per molecule is ≈5 to 7 with the distribution extending up to 10 or more. Rate coefficients based on the computed radical-site populations are comparable to experimentally determined rate coefficients in several cases including soot oxidation by O2 and soot growth by C2H2, assuming both of these reactions are additions involving radical sites in the soot, and soot and tar oxidation by OH, soot mass growth by tar addition, and reactive coagulation of soot precursors, assuming these reactions are radical recombinations. Calculated radical-site populations and measured concentrations of radicals in flames indicate that recombination of CH3, C3H3 and other small radicals with radical sites in tar and soot would contribute significantly to tar and soot formation if the recombination collision efficiencies are 0.1 to 1.},

This paper suggests a method for coupling flow and aerosol transport and dynamics into a single 2-D\Axisymmetric\3-D code which can predict the behavior and evolution of aerosols in arbitrary geometries. Viscous compressible flow is described by the Reduced Navier-Stokes (RNS) equations and the polydisperse particle behavior by an Eulerian aerosol moment model which accounts for particle transport due to convection, diffusion (Brownian and turbulent), inertia and thermophoresis, as well as particle\particle and gas\particle dynamics due to coagulation, nucleation and condensation. Flow and aerosol behavior are computed in separate modules and coupled through an iterative procedure. The influence from any component, e.g. flow or aerosols can thus be easily decoupled, as can subcomponents, e.g. viscosity, compressibility, or aerosol transport or dynamics. Using this method it is possible to directly determine detailed aerosol behavior for a wide range of applications. Present studies are focused on behavior of flow and particles in two and three dimensional compressible and incompressible internal and external geometries. Flow and aerosol behavior in nozzles, inlets and ducts are presented. © 1995 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract        = {The discrete vortex method coupled with the particle-tracking and moment methods have been used to calculate the trajectories of individual nano and fine particles undergoing the coagulation and dispersion in a round jet. The results show that the Stokes number plays an important role in the dispersion of fine particles. The radial dispersion of fine particles for the wavenumber of 5 is the largest when an azimuthal perturbation is introduced to its flow. However, the width of particle dispersion is not always proportional to the amplitude of the azimuthal perturbation. As the round jet flow develops, the mass concentration of nanoparticles within the jet core decreases continuously. The number concentration of nanoparticle decreases rapidly near the jet exit, then decreases slowly in the far field until an asymptotic state is attained. Both the polydispersity and diameter of nanoparticle increase, the rate of increase for the former is the largest near the jet exit, and the largest particles are found near the jet core. The particle diameter is relatively constant across the width of the jet within and outside the jet core except the region near the interface of the jet and the outside. The standard deviation of nanoparticle size distribution increases at the jet exit, approaching slowly at an asymptotic value in the jet core. The minimum and maximum of standard deviation appear between the jet core and edge, and at the jet centerline, respectively. The region of mixing of nanoparticles becomes narrower, however, the particle number concentration grows with increasing Schmidt number. The particle size increases along the radial direction with increasing Damkohler number, and the standard deviation does not change when the Damkohler number is monotonous. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

The coherent structures play an important role in enhancing the particle coagulation and dispersion along the radial direction of jet, and make the particles disperse non-uniformly along the stream direction of jet.

  abstract        = {The dynamics of a single-species aerosol composed of droplets in air is described in terms of nucleation, evaporation, condensation, and coagulation processes. We present a comprehensive overview of the Euler-Euler formulation, which gives rise to a model in which fast nucleation that initiates aerosol droplets co-exists with comparably slow condensation. The latter process is responsible for the subsequent growth of the droplets. To accurately represent the dynamical consequences of the fast nucleation process, while retaining numerical efficiency, a new second-order time-integration method for the nucleation, evaporation, and condensation processes is proposed and analyzed. The new time-integration method takes the form of a 'corrected Euler forward' method. It includes rapid nucleation bursts and their possible cessation within a time step Δt. If the current nucleation burst persists for longer than the next time step, it is included fully, whereas cessation of the nucleation burst within the next Δt implies corrections to the effective rates in the algorithm. The identification of these two situations corresponds to the physical mechanism by which nucleation of a supersaturated vapor is halted because of the progressing condensation onto the already formed droplets. The resulting time-integration method is shown to be second-order accurate in time, whereas the computational costs per time step were found to be increased by less than 25% compared with the Euler forward method. The new method is also applied in combination with advective transport of the aerosol forming vapor to investigate a front of rapid nucleation. Adopting robust first-order upwinding for the spatial discretization, we arrive at a flexible method that shows an overall first-order convergence in Δt. For the full, spatially dependent system motivated by an aerosol of water droplets in air, the computational benefits of the new time-integration method over the Euler forward scheme, are a factor of about 10 improvements in accuracy at a given Δt and a similar factor in computing time when keeping the same level of accuracy. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

The measured growth factors of the bioaerosols ranged from 1.07 to 1.67 under various conditions and these data coincided with calculated results using both the thermodynamic approach and the moment method. The culturable fractions obtained using an Anderson type impactor were observed to increase as a result the formation of the liquid layer around the bioaerosols via condensational growth of the particle, which correspondingly resulted in both increase of physical collection efficiency and decrease of impaction stress. The culturable fractions of sampled bioaerosols increased up to 43% (for S. epidermidis), 27% (for P. fluorescens), and 12% (for E. coli) by condensational growth, compared to no condensational growth. However, the culturable fraction decreased when the condensational growth was excessive, probably due to heat transfer to the bioaerosols during the condensational process. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

The detailed kinetic model considers the oxidation of fuel, the formation and growth of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and particle inception, coagulation, as well as mass growth via surface reactions. A numerical method has been developed, which considers the production of charged particles by thermal ionization as well as coagulation and surface reactions of these particles. The enhancement of coagulation by collisions between charged-charged and charged-neutral particles is rigorously accounted for in the numerical model. The particle size distribution functions for both neutral and charged particles were solved using the method of moments. The computed relative soot volume fractions for neutral and charged soot particles were compared to measurements and found to be in good agreement with them. The results show also that omitting of thermal ionization of soot particles does not lead to significant errors in the simulation of soot formation in the acetylene flame, as long as the nature of the surface reactions between charged particles and gaseous molecules remains the same as that for neutral particles. This result can be generalized to most laboratory laminar premixed and counterflow diffusion flames with flame temperatures not exceeding 2100 K. },

The Brownian coagulation and condensation processes are considered for an aerosol system with three modal aerosol distributions to simulate how the distribution changes when the coarse mode number concentration increases. Simulation results show that during the Brownian coagulation process, the number concentration in the nuclei and accumulation mode decrease due to inter-modal coagulation of the nuclei, accumulation and coarse modes particles. This inter-modal coagulation process is enhanced when the number concentration of the coarse mode increases, such as in dust storm events. It means that the coarse mode can influence on the nuclei and accumulation mode significantly, especially, when the number concentration of the coarse mode becomes large. For the case of gravitational coagulation, the intra-modal coagulation of coarse mode particles makes the number concentration to decrease, while the inter-modal gravitational coagulation between fine modes and coarse mode is negligible.

  abstract      = {The effects of fluid turbulence on the coagulation of aerosols are studied quantitatively and qualitatively. Direct numerical simulation data is used to isolate the effect of the small or subgrid-scale (SGS) particle-particle interactions on nanoparticle coagulation in three-dimensional flows. The rate of particle growth is decomposed into the contribution of the large-scales and small-scales interactions. The contribution of the small-scale interactions is presented as a function of time, space, flow dynamics, and coagulation Damköhler number. Results show that small-scale interactions act to both increase and decrease particle growth. The probability density functions (PDFs) of the SGS growth rate exhibit a negative bias, which increases with time and coagulation Damköhler number. Additionally, PDFs conditioned on the Q-criterion suggest that the contribution of the small-scale interactions primarily act to reduce particle growth in regions characterized by fluid rotation.

  abstract = {The effects of various gaseous additives on soot formation in strained diffusion flames are reported. The additives N2, Ar, He, H2, and CO were introduced with fuels C2H4, C3H8, and C4H10, and were selected to isolate the effects of dilution, temperature, preferential diffusion, and active chemical participation resulting from the additive. Special emphasis was placed on understanding the mechanisms by which CO and H2 addition influence soot inception. Measurements were made of the limiting strain rate for complete suppression of soot, i.e., the soot-particle inception limit, Kp, in the counterflow diffusion flame. Some laser-extinction measurements of soot volume fraction were also made in the coflow flame to determine the applicability of the results to this geometry. The addition of inerts to the fuel decreases the sooting limit due to the reduction in fuel concentration and temperature. Concentration modification due to preferential diffusion enhances the suppressive effect of He, causing it to be the most effective additive considered. The behavior of the reactive additives is more complex. The addition of H2 increases flame temperature but decreases Kp for the fuels considered. Preferential diffusion is partially responsible for this behavior, however direct chemical suppression may also play a role in the strongly suppressive effects of this additive. The chemical role of H2 is discussed in the context of Frenklach's H abstraction/C2H2 addition model for PAH formation. Carbon monoxide addition to C2H4 results in a monotonic decrease in Kp that is primarily a consequence of dilution. For CO addition to the alkanes there is initially an increase in Kp followed by a decrease for XCO > 0.5, suggesting a small chemical enhancement. Coflow results tend to support these findings: For C2H4 the results are consistent with dilution while for C3H8 a small chemical enhancement combined with suppression due to dilution nets a weak suppression of soot formation. This finding, that CO can enhance inception chemistry in alkanes, requires further study.},

Besides the observation of verities of large polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), intense mass peaks of indene, phenylacetylene and propyne confirmed a remarkable quenching of the major active species, benzyl, phenyl and methyl radicals by acetylene. In spite of quenching, only benzyl contributed products were diminished while phenyl and methyl contributed products were enhanced. Uniquely observed symmetrical PAHs; corrannulene/coronene; formed by the active involvement of PAC, \{HACA\} and/or \{MAC\} mechanisms, reflects the interdependencies of these mechanisms.

The optimum residence time for the smallest particles is about one order of magnitude lower than the time required to attain the charge equilibrium state. In practical situations, the maximum attainable number concentration of charged particles is accordingly much lower than in equilibrium conditions.},

The dimensionless time required for an initial size distribution to achieve self-preservation is also derived in both regimes. Once the size distribution becomes self-preserving, the time evolution of the zeroth and second moments can be theoretically obtained, and it is found that the second moment varies linearly with time in the continuum regime. Equivalent equations, rather than the original ones from which they are derived, can be employed to improve the accuracy of the results and reduce the computational cost for Brownian coagulation in the continuum regime as well as the free molecule regime. © 2013 Chinese Society of Particuology and Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences.},

  abstract        = {The evolution of the morphology of primary soot particles was investigated in a laminar premixed flame with the emphasis on the effect of a realistic particle size distribution. A time-dependent Monte-Carlo method was used to calculate flame trajectories of single particles. In the nucleation zone of the flame, particles were grown by coagulation and simultaneous surface growth. The particles for coagulation were selected according to a pre-calculated size distribution obtained by solving the dynamics of the entire soot particle ensemble. In the post-nucleation zone, defined by the point of transition from coalescent to aggregate growth, only surface growth was applied to the particles. The simulation results provide further support to the notion that particle nucleation and the presence of small particles influence the morphology of primary particles and the location of transition. It is demonstrated that the mean size of subparticles comprising the primary particles is substantially smaller when using a realistic size distribution in the nucleation zone of the investigated flame. This, in turn, reduces the degree of aggregation of the primary particles at the time of transition to an extent that surface growth is able to recover their spherical shape in the postnucleation zone. © 2004 The Combustion Institute.

  abstract        = {The evolution of the nascent soot particle size distribution function (PSDF) was determined by mobility sizing for two series of atmospheric pressure premixed ethylene flames in the burner stabilized stagnation flame configuration. The first series of flames has an equivalence ratio of 1.8, corresponding to conditions just above the sooting limit. The second series has an equivalence ratio of 2.5 and is quite heavy in soot production. In each series, six flames were tested in which the cold gas velocity is varied to obtain flame temperatures ranging from 1559 to 1941 K. The temperature profiles were carefully determined and the comparison to pseudo-one dimensional simulations was satisfactory. It was found that the evolution of the PSDFs with respect to flame stoichiometry, temperature and growth time is consistent with the understanding of kinetic competition during soot formation. Finite rate kinetic limitations are observed at lower temperatures and thermodynamic reversibility occurs at higher temperatures. The observed PSDF features are highly sensitive to competition among the various processes of soot formation, from nucleation to coagulation and gas-surface reactions. The PSDFs are mostly bimodal with both nucleation and coagulation mode particles present. The evolution of the PSDF indicates a strong contribution to the mass of coagulation-mode by the nucleation-mode particles. The measured PSDFs offer comprehensive, canonical data sets useful for testing models of soot formation. © 2015 The Combustion Institute.},

  abstract        = {The extinction coefficient of atmospheric aerosol particles influences the earth's radiation balance directly or indirectly, and it can be determined by the scattering and absorption characteristics of aerosol particles. The problem of estimating the change of extinction coefficient due to time evolution of bimodal particle size distribution is studied, and two improved methods for calculating the Brownian coagulation coefficient and the condensation growth rate are proposed, respectively. Through the improved method based on Otto kernel, the Brownian coagulation coefficient can be expressed simply in powers of particle volume for the entire particle size regime based on the fitted polynomials of the mean enhancement function. Meanwhile, the improved method based on Fuchs-Sutugin kernel is developed to obtain the condensation growth rate for the entire particle size regime. And then, the change of the overall extinction coefficient of bimodal distributions undergoing Brownian coagulation and condensation can be estimated comprehensively for the entire particle size regime. Simulation experiments indicate that the extinction coefficients obtained with the improved methods coincide fairly well with the true values, which provide a simple, reliable, and general method to estimate the change of extinction coefficient for the entire particle size regime during the bimodal particle dynamic processes. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.V.},

Both the free molecular and continuum flow are treated. A new derivation of the friction force of an agglomerate in the continuum limit is developed based on the evaluation of the surface momentum flux at the Oseen flow limit. The agglomerates can be described as a fractal, at least in regard to the power law relationship between mass and size, with a dimensionality of 1.7–1.9 independent of the flow regime. The particle growth is shown to be much more rapid in the free molecular regime than in the continuum. The global kinetics are shown to be consistent with a similarity analysis of the coagulation equation with a modified coagulation coefficient. Comparison between the simulation and coagulation theory at small time suggests a slight fluctuation enhancement in the free molecule case and a small-time enhancement of the coagulation rate at high concentration for the continuum case.},

We detail the chemical processes leading to the closure of the first aromatic ring as well as the growth mechanisms leading to amorphous carbon grains. Existing studies on PAH formation in evolved stellar envelopes are reviewed and new results for the modelling of the inner wind of the archetype carbon star IRC+10216 are presented. Benzene, C6H6, forms close to the star, as well as water, H2O, as a result of non-equilibrium chemistry induced by the periodic passage of shocks. The growth process of aromatic rings may thus resemble that active in sooting flames due to the presence of radicals like hydroxyl, OH. Finally, we discuss possible formation processes for PAHs and aromatic compounds in the hydrogen-rich R CrB star, V854 Cen, and their implication for the carriers of the Red Emission and the Diffuse Interstellar Bands.},

The decoration of surfaces with shape- and sizecontrolled metal nanoparticles can be achieved through the reduction of hexafluoroacetylacetonate complexes [M(hfac)x] with H2 in supercritical CO2/alcohol at low temperature with neither catalyst nor surface prefunctionalization. This paper investigates the influence of different alcohols, methanol, ethanol, and isopropanol, used as cosolvent on the reduction kinetics of Cu(hfac)2 ·H20 in the supercritical CO2/alcohol/H2 mixtures. The results are applied to the modeling of the decoration process of silica spheres, used as a model substrate, with copper nanoparticles (5-17 nm). The model, using the decomposition kinetics of the precursor, is based on a bimodal process: (i) an initial homogeneous nucleation in the supercritical media and (ii) a fast heterogeneous growth by coalescence on the surface of the silica particles. We demonstrate good agreements between the simulated results and the experimental data showing an advanced kinetically controlled size of the supported nanoparticles in the range of temperature 100-125 °C and residence time 0-120 min. © 2009 American Chemical Society.},

  abstract = {The formation, growth, and transport of soot is investigated via large scale numerical simulation in a three-dimensional turbulent non-premixed n-heptane/air jet flame at a jet Reynolds number of 15,000. For the first time, a detailed chemical mechanism, which includes the soot precursor naphthalene and a high-order method of moments are employed in a three-dimensional simulation of a turbulent sooting flame. The results are used to discuss the interaction of turbulence, chemistry, and the formation of soot. Compared to temperature and other species controlled by oxidation chemistry, naphthalene is found to be affected more significantly by the scalar dissipation rate. While the mixture fraction and temperature fields show fairly smooth spatial and temporal variations, the sensitivity of naphthalene to turbulent mixing causes large inhomogeneities in the precursor fields, which in turn generate even stronger intermittency in the soot fields. A strong correlation is apparent between soot number density and the concentration of naphthalene. On the contrary, while soot mass fraction is usually large where naphthalene is present, pockets of fluid with large soot mass are also frequent in regions with very low naphthalene mass fraction values. From the analysis of Lagrangian statistics, it is shown that soot nucleates and grows mainly in a layer close to the flame and spreads on the rich side of the flame due to the fluctuating mixing field, resulting in more than half of the total soot mass being located at mixture fractions larger than 0.6. Only a small fraction of soot is transported towards the flame and is completely oxidized in the vicinity of the stoichiometric surface. These results show the leading order effects of turbulent mixing in controlling the dynamics of soot in turbulent flames. Finally, given the difficulties in obtaining quantitative data in experiments of turbulent sooting flames, this simulation provides valuable data to guide the development of models for Large Eddy Simulation and Reynolds Average Navier Stokes approaches.},

The result is two equivalent symmetric models: the SLW Model and the Inverse SLW Model. The advantage of the unified dual formulation and of application of the ALBDF and the Inverse ALBDF is in more efficient implementation of the model and the elimination of the solution of the implicit equations for the absorption cross-sections in the construction of the spectral model in the case of nonisothermal media. The generalized approach explores all possibilities of the SLW method under both direct and inverse formulations including its limiting cases: the minimal one clear gas-one gray gas SLW-1 model, and the case when the number of gray gases approaches infinity termed the Exact SLW model. The present work outlines the steps in a unified construction of the generalized SLW model in isothermal and non-isothermal media, and compares different forms of the modelled radiative quantities in plane parallel media: directional total radiative flux, total emissivity, Planck mean and Rosseland mean absorption coefficients.},

The present review discusses a general scheme of PAH formation and sequential growth of PAH by reactions with stable and radical species, including single-ring aromatics, other PAH and acetylene, followed by the nucleation or inception of small soot particles, soot growth by coagulation and mass addition from gas phase species, and carbonization of the particulate material. Experimental and theoretical tools which have allowed the achievement of deeper insight into the corresponding chemical processes are presented. The significant roles of propargyl (C3H3) and cyclopentadienyl (C5H5) radicals in the formation of first aromatic rings in combustion of aliphatic fuels are discussed. Detailed kinetic modeling of well-defined combustion systems, such as premixed flames, for which sufficient experimental data for a quantitative understanding are available, is of increasing importance. Reliable thermodynamic and kinetic property data are also required for meaningful conclusions, and computational techniques for their determination are presented. Routes of ongoing and future research leading to more detailed experimental data as well as computational approaches for the exploration of elementary reaction steps and the description of systems of increasing complexity are discussed.},

The surface area of the agglomerates is reduced by coalescence. In this study a model is presented that accounts, in addition to nucleation and coagulation, for the shape of the particles by tracing both the particle volume and the total surface area density of the agglomerates. A moment model, based on a unimodal lognormal size distribution gives the concentration, polydispersity, and average volume of the particles as a function of space and time. The total surface area density of the particles is determined by solving an additional transport equation, incorporating a linear decay law to describe the decrease in surface area of a coalescing structure. The aerosol dynamics are calculated in combination with the convective and diffusive particle transport in a spatially inhomogeneous aerosol reactor. © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

  abstract = {The intent of the current work is to present and further validate a new tri-variate model for the formation of soot particles, to apply this model in analyzing the effects of temperature on the formation and growth of soot, and to compare the findings with the present understanding derived from numerous experimental studies. In this novel model, a particle is represented as a fractal shaped aggregate and is described by three independent quantities: the volume, the surface area, and the number of hydrogenated sites (or active sites) on the surface. The introduction of this third variable allows for a better description of the surface reactivity at high temperatures. This approach is extended by a model for the total carbon-to-hydrogen (C/H) ratio of the particle. The model is validated first in high temperature premixed ethylene flames, premixed benzene flames, an acetylene counterflow diffusion flame, and toluene pyrolysis in shock-tubes. Then, the soot volume fraction is computed for a series of atmospheric laminar ethylene premixed flames with varying flame temperatures. The soot model is shown to reproduce the well known bell-shaped temperature dependence of soot volume fraction, which was found in many experiments. It is observed that nucleation is the largest contributor to soot volume fraction at low temperatures while growth by surface reactions is more important at higher temperatures. The surface reactivity and the volumetric carbon-to-hydrogen ratio (C/H) are also computed as a function of temperature. The surface reactivity is found to depend not only on the temperature but also on the particle size and the residence time in the flame. Finally, as observed experimentally, the C/H ratio is found to be essentially constant and close to unity for low temperature flames and increases with residence time in high temperature flames. },

This approach is based on a spatially evolving form of the one-dimensional turbulence (ODT) model that resolves the full range of scales, in a single spatial dimension, from the scale of the plume evolution to that of the soot layers. The model is compared with limited experimental data available. The evolved flow field of a meter-scale flame is then analyzed both in terms of conventional spatial averages and conditional averages. The conditional moments of the terms in the soot and enthalpy evolution equations are analyzed to elucidate the balance between the large-scale evolution (advective terms), the source terms, and the turbulent mixing (dissipative terms). The results show the significant influence of the mixture evolution on the transport of soot relative to the flame (in mixture-fraction space).},

RESS allows the production of particles less than 1 μm and RESS experiments show that particle size depends on solvent, solute and preexpansion conditions. However, an understanding of the underlying physical phenomena of the relationship between the process conditions and the mechanism of particle formation during RESS is still at an early stage. Because of that, there is a need to model the RESS process to get a better understanding of the influencing parameters. The calculations show a steep increase at the beginning of the freejet reaching maximum theoretical supersaturations of ≃ 108 and for an interfacial tension of 0.02 N m-1 maximum nucleation rates of about 10+26 (cm-3 s-1). In the present paper, the influence of the solubility of various solutes in supercritical fluids and of the surface tension group (σ · v(S)/(2/3)/k · T) of the diverse solutes on attainable nucleation rates under typical RESS operation conditions is investigated. The calculations show that the nucleation rate is a sensitive function of the solubility and of the unknown surface tension group. Furthermore, it is shown that the classical nucleation theory is not able to describe the trend in particle size resulting from RESS experiments in a sufficient manner. Also, the present calculations show that it is not possible to investigate homogeneous nucleation and coagulation separately and that there is an enormous need for more reliable information about the solute properties.

The Lagrangian CMC method allows flexibility of flamelet based methods and requires less computational load than Eulerian CMC. It is implemented in OpenFOAM and applied with first and second order closure to the piloted jet diffusion flames near extinction, Sandia Flame D and E. Results show good agreement for all conditional profiles and noticeable improvement by second order correction of four rate limiting steps in the GRI 3.0 mechanism.

Simulations of this configuration are performed using a spatial formulation of the one-dimensional turbulence (ODT) model which is able to resolve individual flames (a key property of this model) and has been shown to provide turbulent statistics that compare well with experimental data for a number of flow configurations including wall fires. In the ODT model diffusion--reaction equations are solved along a notional line of sight perpendicular to the wall that is advanced vertically. Turbulent advection is modeled through stochastic domain mapping processes. A new Darrieus--Landau combustion instability model is incorporated in the ODT eddy selection process. The ODT model is shown to capture the evolution of the flame and describe the intermittent properties at the flame/air interface. Simulations include radiation and soot effects and are compared to experimental temperature measurements. Simulated mean temperatures differ from the experiments by an average of 63 K over all measurement points for the three fuel flow rates. Predicted root mean square temperature fluctuations capture the trends in the experimental data, but overestimate the raw experimental values by a factor of two. This difference is discussed using thermocouple response and heat transfer correction models. Simulated velocity, soot, and radiation properties are also reported.},

  abstract        = {The mechanisms of hydrolysis of zinc particles formed and entrained in a reacting gas flow were explored. Experiments were carried out in a transverse jet reactor designed for nucleation of Zn nanoparticles via a rapid quench followed by reaction at temperatures from 418 to 713K. The aerosol particles were collected on a filter and characterized via X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. Even for quench rates as high as 104K/s, nucleation of Zn vapor was incomplete. With a quench of Ar at temperatures less than the saturation temperature of Zn, 1 to 3μm hour-glass shaped hexagonal Zn particles were formed, consistent with formation via 2-D layer by layer by condensation and subsequent evaporation. Above the saturation temperature, Zn nanowires were formed from the vapor phase on the filter surface. With a steam quench, particles remained hexagonal but were generally smaller, from 300nm to 1μm across the hexagonal face. Above 573K, a shell of ZnO impeded evaporation of particles. Overall conversion of Zn to ZnO was dominated by the heterogeneous hydrolysis of Zn vapor, not hydrolysis of Zn particles. These results shed light on the mechanisms of particle growth and hydrolysis in Zn aerosol reactors. In particular, the finding that hydrolysis is dominated by a heterogeneous reaction between Zn(v) and steam is of critical importance to developing better approaches to react the Zn with steam, supporting prior work that shows that the heterogeneous vapor phase reaction is kinetically favored over the diffusion limited conversion of solid or liquid Zn particles. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

To describe the dynamic properties of particle size distribution, the population balance equation is converted to moment equations by the method of moments and the converted equations are solved numerically. The variations of particle number concentration, geometric mean diameter, and geometric standard deviation are given in the cases that the Brownian diffusion and inertial impaction of particles dominate, respectively. The effects of raindrop size distribution on particle size distribution are analyzed in nine cases. The results show that the particle number concentration decreases as time goes by, and particles dominated by Brownian diffusion are removed more significantly. The particle number concentration decreases much more rapidly when particle geometric mean diameter is smaller, and the particle size distribution tends to be monodisperse. For the same water content, the raindrops with small geometric mean diameters can remove particles with much higher efficiency than those with large geometric mean diameters. Particles in the "Greenfield gap" are relatively difficult to scavenge, and a new method is needed to remove it from the air. © 2013 Fangyang Yuan and Fujun Gan.},

  abstract      = {The moment method can be used to determine the time evolution of particle size distribution due to Brownian coagulation based on the general dynamic equation (GDE). But the function form of the initial particle size distribution must be determined beforehand for the moment method. If the assumed function type of the initial particle size distribution has an obvious deviation from the true particle population, the evolution of particle size distribution may be different from the real evolution tendency. Thus, a simple and general method is proposed based on the moment method. In this method, the Johnson's S B function is chosen as a general distribution function to fit the initial distributions including the log normal (L-N), Rosin-Rammler (R-R), normal (N-N) and gamma distribution functions, respectively. Meanwhile, using the modified beta function to fit the L-N, R-R, N-N and gamma functions is also conducted as a comparison in order to present the advantage of the Johnson's SB function as the general distribution function. And then, the time evolution of particle size distributions using the Johnson's SB function as the initial distribution can be obtained by several lower order moment equations of the Johnson's SB function in conjunction with the GDE during the Brownian coagulation process. Simulation experiments indicate that fairly reasonable results of the time evolution of particle size distribution can be obtained with this proposed method in the free molecule regime, transition regime and continuum plus near continuum regime, respectively, at the early time stage of evolution. The Johnson's SB function has the ability of describing the early time evolution of different initial particle size distributions. © 2013 The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.},

This approach takes the view point that the size distribution of an aerosol is represented by a time-dependent lognormal size distribution function during the deposition process. Numerical calculations have been performed, and the results were found to be in good agreement with the exact solution.

In this system, because the CFL number (obtained from the particle growth rate, grid size, and time step size) depends strongly on the particle size, we need to check the CFL condition (determining the numerical stability and accuracy) over a whole size range before the simulation. This has not been fully discussed in aerosol modeling. The present study introduces a new unique constant (DCFL) throughout the simulation in the volume-ratio grid spacing. In the sensitivity experiments, we can find the similarities of the simulated size distribution and its numerical error, which are determined by the DCFL. We can thus easily check the CFL condition, and choose an appropriate time step size, to satisfy the required accuracy in the nucleation-condensation module of the program. © Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research.},

These properties are necessary to model how aerosols affect climate, and our review is targeted specifically for that application. We recommend the term light-absorbing carbon to avoid conflict with operationally based definitions. Absorptive properties depend on molecular form, particularly the size of sp 2-bonded clusters. Freshly-generated particles should be represented as aggregates, and their absorption is like that of particles small relative to the wavelength. Previous compendia have yielded a wide range of values for both refractive indices and absorption cross section. The absorptive properties of light-absorbing carbon are not as variable as is commonly believed. Our tabulation suggests a mass-normalized absorption cross section of 7.5 ± 1.2 m2/g at 550 nm for uncoated particles. We recommend a narrow range of refractive indices for strongly-absorbing carbon particles, of which the highest is 1.95?0.79i. Our refractive indices are consistent with most measurements reported in the literature, and values used in present-day climate modeling are in error. Realistic refractive indices underpredict measured absorption by about 30% when used with common theories for spherical particles or aggregates. Field programs since about 1970 have measured quantities relevant to light absorption, but have only recently made enough measurements to isolate the light-absorbing carbonaceous component and determine its absorptive properties.},

In the course of the investigations a variety of approaches have been employed. It is the purpose of this paper to review these designs and to comment on them in general as well as in specifics. Since under the conditions of interest the quantities of PCDD/Fs are miniscule compared with other products and reactants and because there are nearly 200 congeners, quantitative information is difficult and expensive to obtain. A second aspect concerns the reaction rates involved. No intrinsic kinetic studies have been conducted and no intrinsic values for PCDD/F rates of formation exist. Such information will be necessary, however. As will be shown below, there seems to exist a basic conflict between reaction rates as may be inferred from some laboratory experiments and rates seemingly required by the time/temperature histories of gases and particles in incinerators.

The model outlined has been created with the intention of being applicable to the prediction of turbulent flames via different approaches. The soot nucleation and surface growth reactions are linked to the gas phase by presuming that pyrolysis products, in the present case acetylene, and not the fuel itself, are of primary importance in the soot formation process. The deduced reaction mechanism is applied to counterflow ethylene and propane flames burning with a range of oxygen-enriched and -depleted air streams.

  abstract = {The present study reports an updated detailed chemical kinetic model for soot formation. The model combines recent developments in gas-phase reactions, aromatic chemistry, soot particle coagulation, soot particle aggregation, and develops a new submodel for soot surface growth. The model was tested against experimental profiles of major and minor chemical species, aromatics, soot volume fractions, and soot particle diameters reported in the literature for nine laminar premixed flames of ethane, ethylene, and acetylene. The numerical agreement between the model predictions and experimental data is generally within a factor of 3. This level of agreement is very encouraging, considering the current uncertainties in the thermodynamics and kinetics of aromatics and soot chemistry. The principal accomplishment of the present study is that the demonstrated level of agreement all around—main flame environment, aromatics, and soot—can be attained with a single reaction model.},

Using these formulations based on the error function, the critical particle size is readily introduced into the log-normal moment method for applications in general aerosol dynamics. In the situation that the particle size distribution is located near the critical size, the proposed moment method (which considers the critical size limit) improves predictions of total particle number and particle volume concentrations as compared with previously well-used log-normal moment methods for sizes ranging from 0 to ∞. However, as the size distribution approaches to the continuum size regime, the influence of the critical size becomes smaller. Thus, the new formulations are expected to improve microphysical parameterization in the free-molecular regime in aerosol-transport models. © 2014 American Association for Aerosol Research.},

In essence, the full particle distribution function is systematically replaced by a set of lower-order mixed moments and corresponding multivariate quadrature points optimally assigned through PCA and back projection. The resulting PCA-QMOM is illustrated for a multivariate normal particle population in order to compare quadrature point assignments with analytic results, but the method is applicable to arbitrary distributions. Physical and optical properties can be reliably estimated by summation over the PCA-assigned quadrature points. Application of the PCA-QMOM to the dynamics of generally mixed particle populations evolving under condensation, coagulation, and sintering is described in the following paper (Part II).},

For special growth laws where analytic results are available for comparison, the QMOM is also found to be exact. The JMT implementation of the QMOM is used to explore the asymptotic behavior of coagulating aerosols at long time. Nondimensional reduced moments are constructed, and found to evolve to constant values in excellent agreement with estimates derived from 'self-preserving' distributions previously obtained by independent methods.

A distribution function which is proportional to 1/S in the low-intensity region is shown to be reasonable on a physical basis. A curve of growth is obtained for a continuous distribution of Lorentz lines which is proportional to 1/S, but cut off at a small value of S and decreases exponentially for large S to permit normalization. The limiting curve of growth for no cutoff (i.e., for a continuous exponential-tailed 1/S intensity distribution for 0\&lt;S\&lt;$\infty$) is found to be a simple, conveniently handled expression. A comparison is made with the curve of growth presented by Godson for a distribution proportional to 1/S up to a maximum S and zero above. A comparison is also made with the curve of growth for a model with a discrete 1/S distribution (consisting of lines whose intensities are in geometric progression), which is calculated numerically from existing tables of the Ladenburg--Reiche function for several values of the intensity ratio. Criteria for the applicability of the curves of growth for the 1/S models are discussed; the curve developed here and the Ladenburg--Reiche curve form (approximate) lower and upper limits, respectively, to the curve of growth for any physically reasonable band model consisting of Lorentz lines.},

By comparing the calculated behavior of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon formation, nucleation, and the particle size distribution with experimentally observed configurations for carbon black, the impact of the benzene-acetylene composition on the configuration of carbon black is discussed. The nuclei mole fraction increases with additive concentration, which strongly affects the complexity of the aggregate shape. Specifically, when the amount of benzene added to 3.0. vol% acetylene is increased to 5.0. vol% benzene, the particle number concentration of 30-80-nm-sized particles, which are considered as primary particles or spherical aggregates, increases. The increase in the number concentration of 30-80-nm-sized particles contributes to the simplification of the aggregate shapes. When acetylene is added to 1.0. vol% benzene, although the particle size distribution at 200. ms begins to shift to a bimodal shape with the addition of 0.5. vol% acetylene, a log-normal shape clearly appears at 200. ms with the addition of 5.0. vol% acetylene because the nuclei mole fraction reaches equilibrium at 200. ms. Thus, if the reaction is quenched before small particles (<10. nm in size) collide with larger particles with a log-normal shape, the complexity of the aggregate shape increases. The results for both of these cases indicate that the calculated nucleation behavior and the particle size distribution describe the aggregate shapes obtained experimentally. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

Peak temperature and subsequent temperature drop were found to be the dominant factors affecting the condensation process. Fuel-rich and fuel-lean conditions result in lower peak temperatures and a more rapid temperature drop relative to stoichiometric conditions. Since the metal vapor saturation pressure falls exponentially with temperature a larger condensation rate was observed, as long as nucleation was suppressed. Fuel-rich conditions promote the formation of soot particles. These particles function as sites for subsequent metal-species condensation.

  abstract = {The scope of this study is the application of the recently developed univariate moment method Extended Quadrature Method of Moments (EQMOM) (Yuan et al., 2012) to model soot formation in flames. Furthermore, it is combined with another advanced moment approach, called the Conditional Quadrature Method of Moments (CQMOM) (Yuan and Fox, 2011), and this extension leads to a bivariate model. Retaining the efficiency of a moment method, EQMOM enables the reconstruction of the number density function. CQMOM is a numerically robust multivariate moment method which allows a bivariate soot particle description in terms of particle volume and surface to take into account aggregation. The joint Extended Conditional Quadrature Method of Moments (ECQMOM) model combines the advantages of the two methods to arrive at a numerically efficient bivariate moment method which captures both the particle size distribution and the formation of aggregates. Both the EQMOM and the ECQMOM model are validated against experimental results for premixed burner-stabilized ethylene flames. Thereby, the gas phase is modeled using a modified version of a very detailed, well-established kinetic scheme, which is adapted to be consistent with the moment methods introduced. The results demonstrate the suitability of the applied models to describe both soot precursors and soot evolution in flames. Furthermore, the ability of the moment approaches to represent the statistical soot model accurately is evaluated comparing EQMOM and ECQMOM to other numerical approaches, which are based on the Monte Carlo method, the standard Gaussian Quadrature Method of Moments and the Gaussian-Radau Quadrature Method of Moments, respectively.},

  abstract = {The secondary reactions of volatile compounds, including coal tar and light gases, accounts for a great portion of soot formation and the subsequent heat release and pollutant emissions in the combustion zone. While coal primary pyrolysis has been extensively studied over the last few decades and several network pyrolysis models has been developed to describe this process, coal secondary pyrolysis is still not well understood. The Babcock and Wilcox Company has been investigating coal secondary pyrolysis in order to develop a comprehensive mechanism for inclusion in predictive computational fluid dynamics and coal combustion models. Supportive experiments were carried out in an entrained-flow reactor. Tar was extracted from the pyrolysis byproducts of seven coals of widely-distributed rank at temperatures ranging from 923 to 1473K, and analyzed by 13C NMR. Tars formed from higher rank coals generally demonstrated higher sooting propensities. This rank-dependent sooting propensity is associated with tar’s chemical structure properties. With increased heat treatment severity, tar molecules lose a substantial amount of aliphatic attachments, and the average size of substitution per cluster decreases. Compared to tars formed from high-rank bituminous coals, those formed from low-rank sub-bituminous coals have a larger attachment portion, higher averaged substitution, and higher oxygen-containing functional groups. These differences contribute to the higher cracking propensity observed for low-rank coal tars.},

  abstract      = {The sectional aerosol behavior code COSIMA simulates the time evolution of the structural, dynamical, and optical properties of airborne agglomerate particles as well as their heterogeneous chemical interactions with reactive trace gases utilizing a formalism based on fractal scaling laws. The modeled processes include diffusion to the walls and sedimentational deposition, Brownian and gravitational coagulation, molecular transport from the gas phase to the accessible particle surface, surface adsorption and reactions, gas phase reactions, and dilution effects due to sampling (e.g. during aerosol chamber experiments). The effect of hydrodynamic interactions and shielding on particle mobility is considered within the framework of the Kirkwood-Riseman theory. Rayleigh-Debye-Gans theory is used to deal with light absorption and scattering. The code is validated against new experimental data on the dynamics of Diesel and graphite spark soot as well as recent theoretical and simulation results. Applying the Kirkwood-Riseman formalism to compute the mobility of fractal like agglomerates significantly enhances coagulation rates as well as wall and depositional loss but does not affect the form of the self preserving size distributions attained in the long time regime if Brownian coagulation dominates the aerosol dynamics. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract        = {The silicon age that started in the 60s of the last century has changed the world profoundly, mainly related to the invention and development of microprocessor technology. Meanwhile, the demand for silicon is driven by the photovoltaics industry that consumes about 80% of the high-purity silicon produced worldwide. Independent of the final product, all high-purity silicon has passed through a couple of gas-phase reactions for purification. The most important gaseous species within this production chain are chlorosilanes and monosilane. We will discuss the direct formation of crystalline silicon by homogeneous gas-phase reactions as a direct and highly economical way to produce the required high-purity raw material for silicon solar cells. The direct formation of solid silicon particles from monosilane requires only a fraction of the energy compared to the established Siemens process based on the chemical vapor deposition of silanes. We have developed a method to synthesize nanocrystalline silicon powder using a hot-wall reactor, and the technology was scaled up to the pilot-plant scale. While an economical production strategy is decisive for solar cell production, the structure of the gas-phase product allows for additional, highly promising applications benefiting from the specific properties of the nanoscale particulate material. Both, thermoelectric generators as well as lithiumion batteries benefit from the nanocrystalline structure of the gas-phase product due to high phonon scattering and short diffusion lengths, respectively. First successful examples with regard to these two topics will be discussed. In these fields, silicon finds potential new markets for sustainable energy technology because of its abundant availability and low-cost production. © 2011 Hosokawa Powder Technology Foundation.},

  abstract = {The simultaneous measurement of soot volume fraction by laser induced incandescence (LII) and qualitative imaging of \{OH\} by laser induced fluorescence (LIF) was performed in a JP-8 pool fire contained in a 152 mm diameter pan. Line of sight extinction was used to calibrate the \{LII\} system in a laminar flame, and to provide an independent method of measuring average soot volume fraction in the turbulent flame. The presence of soot in the turbulent flame was found to be approximately 50% probable, resulting in high levels of optical extinction, which increased slightly through the flame from approximately 30% near the base, to approximately 50% at the tip. This high soot loading pushes both techniques toward their detection limit. Nevertheless, useful accuracy was obtained, with the \{LII\} measurement of apparent extinction in the turbulent flame being approximately 21% lower than a direct measurement, consistent with the influence of signal trapping. The axial and radial distributions of soot volume fraction are presented, along with \{PDFs\} of volume fraction, and new insight into the behavior of soot sheets in pool fires are sought from the simultaneous measurements of \{OH\} and LII. },

A turbulent diffusive flow is forced into the reactor to guarantee a complete conversion of the reactants and the production of small diameter particles. Furthermore, the particle formation can be well represented by means of the general dynamic equation (GDE). To allow a coupling between the solution of the fluid dynamic fields and the representation of the particle evolution within the reactor, the method of moments was applied to GDE to determine the most important statistical variables of a particle.},

  abstract = {The small-scale interactions between turbulence, chemistry, and soot have a profound effect on the soot formation, growth, and destruction processes in turbulent reacting flows. In this work, the small-scale subfilter interactions between turbulence and soot are modeled using a presumed subfilter PDF for the statistical moments of the soot number density function. Due to a very large (infinite) Schmidt number, soot is confined to very thin structures. In addition, soot is formed initially from Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons, which exhibit a strong sensitivity to the local scalar dissipation rate in the flow field. These interactions of soot with the gas-phase chemistry, molecular transport, and turbulence result in very high spatial and temporal intermittency. Therefore, the soot subfilter PDF is presumed to be a pair of delta distributions with a sooting mode and a non-sooting mode. In addition to the mean values of the scalars, one additional parameter is needed to specify this distribution. The presumed soot subfilter PDF approach is evaluated a priori using a recent two-dimensional direct numerical simulation (DNS) database of soot evolution in a nonpremixed flame. The analysis shows that predictions of the soot intermittency as well as the soot source terms are improved with this presumed soot subfilter PDF approach compared to simply using the mean values of the soot scalars. Several choices for specifying the additional parameter of the PDF are also evaluated with the database. The results show that the parameter is best specified using the second moment of the soot number density. In addition, the transport equation for the second moment of the number density is briefly discussed. A model for the lone unclosed term is proposed and evaluated with the DNS data. },

  abstract        = {The Smoluchowski equation has become a fundamental equation in nanoparticle processes since it was proposed in 1917, whereas the achievement of its analytical solution remains a challenging issue. In this work, a new analytical solution, which is absolutely different from the conventional asymptotic solutions, is first proposed and verified for non-self-preserving nanoparticle systems in the free molecular regime. The Smoluchowski equation is first converted to the form of moment ordinary differential equations by the performance of Taylor expansion method of moments and subsequently resolved by the separate variable technique. In the derivative, a novel variable, g = m0m2/m12, where m0, m1 and m2 are the first three moments, is first revealed which can be treated as constant. Three specific models are proposed, two with a constant g (an Analytical Model with Constant g (AMC), and a Modified Analytical Model with Constant g (MAMC)), and another with varying g(a finite Analytical Model with Varying g (AMV)). The AMC model yields significant errors, while its modified version, i.e., the MAMC model, is able to produce highly reliable results. The AMV is verified to have the capability to solve the Smoluchowski equation with the same precision as the numerical method, but an iterative procedure has to be employed in the calculation. © Taiwan Association for Aerosol Research.},

  abstract        = {The solar thermal decomposition of methane is a promising route for the large scale production of hydrogen and carbon black with zero CO2 emissions, however careful control of the reactor is required to ensure product particles of specific sizes. A one-dimensional model employing a sectional method is developed to simulate the evolution of polydisperse fresh and seed particle populations in an indirectly heated solar reactor. The model accounts for the homogeneous nucleation of fresh particles, the heterogeneous growth of the fresh and seed particles, particle coagulation, and the growth of carbon on the walls of the reactor from heterogeneous reaction and particle deposition. The heat transport mechanisms modelled include wall-gas convection, wall-particle radiation exchange, particle-gas convection and heat release from chemical reaction. The model is validated in terms of methane conversion against a 10 kW experimental solar reactor and used to extract kinetic parameters for the homogeneous and heterogeneous reaction paths. The model shows promise as a quick and simple tool for the design and control of industrial scale solar reactors. © 2010 Professor T. Nejat Veziroglu. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

In addition, complementary simulations with detailed polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) chemistry and a detailed soot model, based on the Hybrid Method of Moments (HMOM), were performed and compared with the experimental critical strain rates for the sooting flames. Argon dilution was used to keep the thermal environment for the three fuel cases nearly the same to elucidate the chemical effects. Both experiment and simulation showed that n-heptane and n-butanol had similar sooting characteristics, while methyl butanoate had the least sooting propensity. Further sensitivity and reaction path analysis demonstrates that the three fuels share similar PAH chemical pathways, and C5 and C6 ring formation from the intermediate chain species is found to be the rate-limiting step. The differences in sooting propensity lie in the fuel breakdown processes. Specifically, the oxygen bounded in n-butanol does not reduce soot precursor concentrations but is primarily involved in intramolecular water elimination reactions. On the contrary, the fuel bound oxygen in methyl butanoate shortens the carbon chain of the soot precursors and promotes their oxidation, which reduces the total carbon available for soot formation. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

However, this effect was small compared to that of adjusting modelled surface tension. Only by adjusting this was it possible to reproduce correctly the downstream evolution of particle number found in experiment. Particle mass mean diameter was significantly underpredicted at the centre of the jet, which may be due to the inability of log-normal size distribution to capture the distribution in detail. Taking account of turbulent fluctuations leads to increased mean particle size at the edge of the plume. The extent of this increase is strongly dependent on the choice of micromixing timescale. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The temperature and major species concentration profiles were measured with spontaneous Raman scattering and computationally simulated with detailed kinetics and transport. Good agreement was found between the experimental data and the computational simulation. It was further shown that the previously developed global and local sooting limit correlations are again applicable, respectively relating the density-weighted strain rate at the sooting limit with the global parameters of the system pressure and the fuel mole fraction in the fuel stream, and with the local flame parameter of the peak acetylene partial pressure. In addition, the local correlations for the propane and ethylene flames collapse into a single relation. An interpretation of these correlations is provided, and their fundamental importance is emphasized.},

Several flames of the same fuel flow-rate yet various air flow-rates were examined. Heights of visible flames were obtained using measurements of hydroxyl (OH) laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) and visible images. Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) LIF and soot laser-induced incandescence (LII) were also measured. In visible images, radiating soot masks the blue region typically associated with the flame height in normal diffusion flames (NDFs). Increased air flow- rates resulted in longer flames. PAH LIF and soot LII indicated that PAH and soot are present on the fuel side of the flame and that soot is located closer to the reaction zone than PAH. Ethylene flames produced significantly higher PAH LIF and soot LII signals than methane flames, which is consistent with the sooting propensity of ethylene.},

A special kind of coordinate diagram, which describes the relationship between the moment equations and one non-dimensional moment is first used to investigate different methods of moments that only involve the first three moments.

  abstract        = {The use of Global Circulation Models (GCM) or mesoscale models are now widely used to understand planetary climatic systems. The increasing complexity of the models and the more and more detailed observations of the planetary bodies necessitate a corresponding increase in the complexity of the physical processes which are included in these models. In all the planetary atmospheres in the solar system, aerosols and clouds can be found and therefore microphysical processes must be included in climate models. The most accurate models are those where aerosol and cloud droplet size distributions are described with bins. This type of sophisticated and accurate models only needs a small quantity of a priori information to be used. However, they are demanding in computational resource. They can only be used in GCM at the cost of very long, and sometime prohibitive, time of computation. Alternatively, an other class of microphysical models, based on the description of the aerosol and cloud distributions with moments of distribution can be used. But, they need first to be developed and compared with a more detailed model and they need an a priori information about the size distributions. In this article, we describe the development of the microphysical equations to treat the interaction of two populations of aerosols, with different geometrical structures, written with moment of distributions, interacting through Brownian coagulation. This problem was solved specifically for the case of Titan, the larger satellite of Saturn, where small aerosols have a spherical shape, large aerosols have a fractal aggregated structure and where aerosols bear an electric charge. The two populations interact in the mesosphere. The fractal structure of the large aerosols also has a consequence on the shape of the size distribution and on the laws of the microphysics that must be accounted a priori in the method. The case of Titan is probably one of the most complex and, in this work, we have written the set of equations in the most general way so they can be used for any other cases. Once developed, we finally compare the results yielded by our new model with the results obtained with the classical model based on a description in bins. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

Uses a harmonic mean between continuum and free-molecular values—not great. Uses a probability function to determine whether a collision of two spherical particles results in a larger spherical particle or a fractal aggregate. Uses a one-dimensional model that accounts for electrically charged aerosol particles and sedimentation. Validation for moment method performed against results for a binning method. Results of the comparison look good if the electrical charge is taken into account. The references are all rather old and includes almost nothing that I recognize. The main contribution to the field appears to be the application of a moment method and that the coagulation description includes both spherical and aggregate processes.},

Agglomerate particles coagulate more rapidly than do dense particles due to their larger collision cross sections. Experimental studies have been conducted to explore a number of aspects of the evolution of aggregate aerosols. The structure-drag relationship has been explored by image analysis of transmission electron micrographs of mobility classified aggregate particles. Structural rearrangements during sintering of aggregates have been explored by heat treating aggregate particles while they are still entrained in the carrier gas. Particles are observed to retain the appearance of fractal clusters of smaller primary particles throughout coalescence that leads to many primary particles from the original particle being incorporated into a single primary particle in the sintered agglomerate. This observation raises serious questions about the inference of mechanisms of particle growth from structure measurements alone. © 1994.},

A number of assumptions and simplifications are of necessity incorporated in applying a radiation-correction to a thermocouple measurement, but the assumptions made in different investigations have often been poorly-documented or are inconsistent with the relevant literature guidance. This paper reviews the considerations in performing an energy balance on practical thermocouple junctions and assesses the best available information regarding the appropriate choices to make in performing radiation corrections. In particular, the effects of Nusselt number correlation, thermocouple wire and junction size, the local gas mixture transport properties, and the thermocouple emissivity are explored.

The simulation is based on a preconditioning method developed by Yamamoto, together with mathematical models for thermophysical properties of substances in a program package for thermophysical properties of fluids (PROPATH). A primary issue was the extent to which changing the nozzle inlet and outlet pressures impacted the solubility of the solute. We also studied the effects of changing the nozzle throat diameter and throat length. In addition, we used a simple particle-formation model to predict nucleation, condensation, and coagulation of naphthalene particles.

  abstract = {This article presents a chemical mechanism for the high temperature combustion of a wide range of hydrocarbon fuels ranging from methane to iso-octane. The emphasis is placed on developing an accurate model for the formation of soot precursors for realistic fuel surrogates for premixed and diffusion flames. Species like acetylene (C2H2), propyne (C3H4), propene (C3H6), and butadiene (C4H6) play a major role in the formation of soot as their decomposition leads to the production of radicals involved in the formation of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH) and the further growth of soot particles. A chemical kinetic mechanism is developed to represent the combustion of these molecules and is validated against a series of experimental data sets including laminar burning velocities and ignition delay times. To correctly predict the formation of soot precursors from the combustion of engine relevant fuels, additional species should be considered. One normal alkane (n-heptane), one ramified alkane (iso-octane), and two aromatics (benzene and toluene) were chosen as chemical species representative of the components typically found in these fuels. A sub-mechanism for the combustion of these four species has been added, and the full mechanism has been further validated. Finally, the mechanism is supplemented with a sub-mechanism for the formation of larger PAH molecules up to cyclo[cd]pyrene. Laminar premixed and counterflow diffusion flames are simulated to assess the ability of the mechanism to predict the formation of soot precursors in flames. The final mechanism contains 149 species and 1651 reactions (forward and backward reactions counted separately). The mechanism is available with thermodynamic and transport properties as supplemental material.},

Initially, a typical aerosol process is considered and a detailed population balance model is presented which describes how the aerosol size distribution evolves with time. The population balance is complemented with mass and energy balances that describe the evolution of the continuous phase species and temperature of the system. Sectional representations and unimodal lognormal moment approximations of the population balance model are then derived and solved. It is found that the moment model provides reasonably accurate estimates of the average properties of the aerosol size distribution computed by the sectional model for long times. Then, a nonlinear state estimator is constructed on the basis of the moment model, which employs measurements of the geometric average particle diameter to compute the evolution of the average properties of the aerosol size distribution. Finally, a nonlinear controller is designed on the basis of the moment model and is implemented on the sectional model to achieve an aerosol size distribution with desired geometric average particle diameter. The robustness properties of the nonlinear estimator and controller with respect to significant parametric model uncertainty are successfully tested through computer simulations. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

  abstract        = {This article presents a study of the effect of size-dependent surface tension, on the formation and evolution of nanoparticles during gas-to-particle conversion. The nuclei formation rates have been computed from chemical reaction like formulation as opposed to the most commonly used expression from kinetic homogeneous nucleation theory derived on the basis of steady-state assumption and capillarity approximation (size-independent constant surface tension). This is achieved with discrete nodal model. We validate the present model by comparing the solution for Aluminum particle growth with our earlier NGDE model [Prakash, A., Bapat, A. P., & Zachariah, M.R. (2003). A simple numerical algorithm and software for solution of nucleation, surface growth, and coagulation problems. Aerosol Science and Technology, 37, 892-898], a system that shows a size-dependent surface tension. The results indicate that although the quasi-steady-state assumption of the dynamics is reasonable, the capillarity approximation significantly over-predicts the size of the particles. © 2006.},

The proposed scheme can completely overcome the shortcoming of the existing TEMOM and substantially improve the accuracy for both integer and fractional moments. In the generalized TEMOM, the optimal number of equations is 2+1, where is an integer greater than zero. The existing TEMOM is a special case of the generalized TEMOM when is 1. The generalized TEMOM was tested for aerosols undergoing Brownian coagulation in the continuum regime, and it was verified to achieve nearly the same accuracy as the quadrature method of moments (QMOM) with a fractional moment sequence, and higher accuracy than the QMOM with an integer moment sequence. Regarding accuracy and efficiency, the generalized TEMOM scheme was verified to be a competitive method for solving the population balance equation.Copyright 2015 American Association for Aerosol Research © 2015 Copyright © American Association for Aerosol Research.},

The performance of this model is validated by comparing its predictions with literature results for pure particle diffusion, pure particle coagulation and pure thermophoresis. The interplay between these aerosol processes is investigated in the parameter space of the model focusing on the overall particle deposition efficiency (or, inversely, penetration). Aerosol penetration curves for non-isothermal, laminar tube flows are presented in the presence and absence of coagulation. Applications of this work are in the non-isothermal transport of particle laden streams through circular tubes (heat exchangers) and in the manufacture of lightguide preforms by modified chemical vapor deposition. © 1989.},

A lognormal moment ap-proximations of the population balance model is then presented. Then, the robust state feedback controller is designed for the aerosol process with some unknown uncertainties, the proposed controller is composed of an nominal control term and a robust control term so that it only ensures the stability of the closed-loop system, but also attenuates the effect of the unknown uncertainties on the system. A high-gain observer is adopted to estimate state variables required in the on-line implementation of the state feedback. Finally, the proposed robust controller is applied to an aerosol process for achieving an aerosol size distribution with desired geometric average particle diameter, the simulation results show the robustness properties of the controller with respect to parametric model uncertainty and unmodeled dynamics. © 2006-2010 by CCC Publications.},

The flow/heat transfer and gas-phase chemical kinetics are simulated utilizing separate one-way coupled models. The aerosol dynamics model is based on a simplified sectional model originally developed by Okuyama et al. This model is modified to allow for the simulation of particle growth via condensation. Simulations have been performed which indicate that particle growth via condensation may be an important process. Additionally, the effects of total reactor pressure, temperature and inlet silane concentration on the dynamics of the aerosol population have been investigated.

The breakup scheme alone compares nearly exactly with a constant-kernel analytical solution at a 300-s time step. The combined coagulation/breakup schemes are stable and conservative, regardless of the time step and number of size bins, and convergent with higher temporal and size resolution. The schemes were designed with these characteristics in mind for use in longterm global or regional simulations. The use of 30 geometrically spaced size bins and a time step of 60 s provides a good compromise between obtaining sufficient accuracy (relative to a much higher-resolution result) and speed, although solutions with a 600-s time step and 30 bins are stable and conservative and take one-eighth the computer time. The combined coagulation/breakup schemes were implemented into the nested Gas, Aerosol, Transport, Radiation, General Circulation, Mesoscale, and Ocean Model (GATORGCMOM), a global-urban climate-weather-air pollution model. Coagulation was solved over liquid, ice, and graupel distributions and breakup simultaneously over the liquid distribution. Each distribution included 30 size bins and 16 chemical components per bin. Timing tests demonstrate the feasibility of the scheme in long-term global simulations. © 2011 American Meteorological Society.},

In this configuration, the aerosol dynamics is essentially driven by convection and turbulent-Brownian aggregation. Numerical results are compared to available experimental data: space-resolved PSD measurements for the particulate phase and mean airflow velocity, turbulence kinetic energy and mean age of air profiles for the gas phase. Given the experimental uncertainties, a good agreement between experimental and simulation results is found. The use of two types of aerosols, with identical initial concentration but different compositions, sizes and morphologies highlights the influence of these parameters on aggregation kinetics. The highest particle number reduction due to aggregation is achieved for the smallest and least compact nanoparticles. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

The method combines detailed chemistry and the method of moments with interpolative closure (MoMIC) population balance model in a commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code. We show details of the implementation and present an extensive set of numerical experiments and validation. We consider the example of the chloride process for the industrial synthesis of titania. We show good agreement with experimental data and present fully coupled detailed chemistry CFD simulations of nanoparticle formation in a representative 'slot' reactor geometry. The simulations show that inception occurs in a mixing zone near the reactor inlets. Most of the nanoparticle mass is due to surface growth downstream of the mixing zone with a narrower size distribution occurring in the regions of higher surface growth. The predicted temperature and particle properties are compared to a perfect mixing case. The implications for the second part of the methodology, where it is proposed to post-process the data using a more detailed particle model, are discussed critically. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract        = {This paper presents a detailed study of the numerical behaviour of stochastic weighted algorithms (SWAs) using the transition regime coagulation kernel and a multidimensional silica particle model. The implementation in the SWAs of the transition regime coagulation kernel and associated majorant rates is described. The silica particle model of Shekar et al. [S. Shekar, A.J. Smith, W.J. Menz, M. Sander, M. Kraft, A multidimensional population balance model to describe the aerosol synthesis of silica nanoparticles, Journal of Aerosol Science 44 (2012) 83-98] was used in conjunction with this coagulation kernel to study the convergence properties of SWAs with a multidimensional particle model. High precision solutions were calculated with two SWAs and also with the established direct simulation algorithm. These solutions, which were generated using large number of computational particles, showed close agreement. It was thus demonstrated that SWAs can be successfully used with complex coagulation kernels and high dimensional particle models to simulate real-world systems. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract        = {This paper presents a methodology for the design of an integrated fault detection and fault-tolerant control (FD-FTC) architecture for particulate processes described by population balance models (PBMs) with control constraints, actuator faults and a limited number of process measurements. The architecture integrates model-based fault detection, state estimation, nonlinear feedback and supervisory control on the basis of an appropriate reduced-order model that captures the dominant dynamics of the process and is obtained through application of the method of weighted residuals. The architecture comprises a family of control configurations together with a fault detection filter and a supervisor. For each configuration, a stabilizing output feedback controller with well-characterized stability properties is designed through the combination of a state feedback controller and a state observer that uses the available measurements of principal moments of the particle size distribution (PSD) and the continuous-phase variables to provide appropriate state estimates. A fault detection filter that simulates the behavior of the fault-free, reduced-order model is designed, and its discrepancy from the behavior of the actual process state estimates is used as a residual for fault detection. Finally, a switching law based on the stability regions of the constituent control configurations is derived to reconfigure the control system in a way that preserves closed-loop stability in the event of fault detection. Appropriate fault detection thresholds and control reconfiguration criteria that account for model reduction and state estimation errors are derived for the implementation of the FD-FTC architecture on the particulate process. Finally, the methodology is applied to the problem of constrained, actuator fault-tolerant stabilization of an unstable steady-state of a continuous crystallizer. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {This paper presents results from the direct numerical simulation (DNS) of flame kernels in various turbulent environments. The flames are fully premixed and propagate through a field of decaying isotropic turbulence. The DNS code solves the fully compressible reacting flow equations using high-order explicit finite differences in space and a third-order explicit Runge-Kutta method in time. Results have been obtained for three-dimensional time evolution of initially laminar flame kernels. The normalized turbulence intensity u′/SL was varied from moderately low values that produce only minor flame-wrinkling effects to larger values that produce severe wrinkling. When the turbulence intensity is large in comparison with the laminar flame speed, holes begin to appear in the flame surface and evidence of local flame breakaway is observed. Flame kernels have significant mean curvature, and it is the curvature and other geometrical properties of the flame surface that form the main focus of the present work. Simulation results are presented for a number of different turbulence Reynolds numbers corresponding to computational grid sizes with up to 3843 points, and a detailed analysis provides statistical data on flame curvature and local shape effects. Turbulence intensity is found to have a major influence on the extent and character of the observed flame wrinkling. In particular, effects due to the mean curvature of the kernel are shown to diminish strongly with increasing turbulence intensity.},

In order to evaluate aggregate break up, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) images were analyzed to compare the soot nanostructure of the bridge sites with the particle sites. Results demonstrated that the bridge sites were formed by less-ordered nanostructure indicating a higher oxidation potential than particle sites. In addition, the feasibility of internal burning in the single particles was tested through an analysis of intraparticle diffusion. In this case, the actual oxygen diffusion pathway as well as effective spacing between the crystalline structures was estimated by the image analysis technique. By using the obtained data in the effectiveness factor calculation, it was found that the possibility of internal burning by O2 molecules increased for particles less than 10 nm as compared to larger particles. In addition, increasing temperature decreased the potential for internal burning. © 2015 The Combustion Institute.},

  abstract    = {This report documents the results of a project funded by DoD’s Strategic Environmental Research and Development Program (SERDP) on the science behind development of predictive models for soot emission from gas turbine engines. Measurements of soot formation were performed in laminar flat premixed flames and turbulent non-premixed jet flames at 1 atm pressure and in turbulent liquid spray flames under representative conditions for takeoff in a gas turbine engine. The laminar flames and open jet flames used both ethylene and a prevaporized JP-8 surrogate fuel composed of n-dodecane and m-xylene. The pressurized turbulent jet flame measurements used the JP-8 surrogate fuel and compared its combustion and sooting characteristics to a world-average JP-8 fuel sample. The pressurized jet flame measurements demonstrated that the surrogate was representative of JP-8, with a somewhat higher tendency to soot formation. The premixed flame measurements revealed that flame temperature has a strong impact on the rate of soot nucleation and particle coagulation, but little sensitivity in the overall trends was found with different fuels. An extensive array of non-intrusive optical and laser-based measurements was performed in turbulent non-premixed jet flames established on specially designed piloted burners. Soot concentration data was collected throughout the flames, together with instantaneous images showing the relationship between soot and the OH radical and soot and PAH. A detailed chemical kinetic mechanism for ethylene combustion, including fuel-rich chemistry and benzene formation steps, was compiled, validated, and reduced. The reduced ethylene mechanism was incorporated into a high-fidelity LES code, together with a moment- based soot model and models for thermal radiation, to evaluate the ability of the chemistry and soot models to predict soot formation in the jet diffusion flame. The LES results highlight the importance of including an optically-thick radiation model to accurately predict gas temperatures and thus soot formation rates. When including such a radiation model, the LES model predicts mean soot concentrations within 30% in the ethylene jet flame.},

Governing equations for energy, lower order radial moments of the particle size distribution, and vapor transport are written for a two-dimensional model using both approaches. Conventional and quadrature techniques to obtain closure of the moment equations are applied and compared. The conventional method requires certain approximations to the growth law. These include assumptions that the Kelvin effect is negligible and that the particle growth rate function is linear in particle size. In contrast, restrictive constraints of the conventional method of moments to obtain closure are avoided by applying the quadrature method. Numerical results for the laminar flow aerosol reactor model are obtained for a six moment formulation of the seed particle distribution to illustrate application of the quadrature method to continuous polydisperse distributions. We present the first calculations with the new quadrature method of moments to a two-dimensional aerosol transport and growth model.},

  abstract      = {This study is part of an ongoing European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) programme ('SAMPLE'). The effects of gas stream flow regimes in the sample transport line and dilution strategies for removal of the volatile fraction on measured PM size distribution are evaluated behind a simulated aeroderivative gas turbine exhaust using a fast mobility DMS500 particle sizer. The PM size distribution and concentration within the primary transport sample was found to be relatively insensitive to flow regime, with conditions of turbulent flow (lowest residence time) providing the highest number concentrations, and hence least losses. However, given the natural variation of PM production from the combustor source the statistical certainty of these observations require consolidation. A 'bespoke' volatile particle removal system based on the European automotive PMP protocol was constructed to allow the effects of dilution ratio and evaporation tube residence time to be investigated. It was shown that both strategies of increasing dilution ratio and residence times in the evaporation tube did not affect the size distribution at the two distinct nucleation and accumulation modes to any statistical certainty. When using high (420:1) dilution ratios in the VPR, a third larger (200nm) mode appears, which requires further investigation. Copyright © 2012 by ASME.},

  abstract        = {This work examines the applicability of various assumptions in implementation of the quadrature method of moments (QMOM) for solving problems in aerosol science involving simultaneous nucleation, surface growth and coagulation. The problem of aerosol growth and coagulation in a box and the problem of vapor condensation in a nozzle are reworked using quadrature method of moments. QMOM uses Gaussian quadrature to evaluate integrals appearing in the moment equations and therefore does not require any assumptions on the form of the size distribution function, the growth laws and coagulation kernels. Results are compared with calculations which assume a lognormal size distribution. The conditions for which one, two and higher quadrature points can be used in the quadrature formula and the issues regarding the accuracy are considered for combined aerosol nucleation, growth and coagulation processes. Results show that for these problems, the simplest 1-point quadrature scheme gives accuracy comparable with the lognormal calculations while using two and higher point quadrature gives highly accurate results. Some difficulties associated with the QMOM are discussed and some insights are provided. © 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract        = {This work investigates the effects of reduced accessible surface area of aggregate particles and of surface energy on relevant particle formation and growth mechanisms during titania formation from the vapour phase at industrial process conditions. Growth due to surface reaction and due to condensation is related to the fraction of the surface area that is exposed to the collision with single molecules. Surface shielding is found to hamper surface reaction and condensation once fractal aggregates start to form. It leads to significantly retarded precursor consumption and produces aggregate particles, which consist of more, but smaller primary particles. Surface energy data are varied within a range as proposed by available literature data. Moderate and high surface energy values result in a thermodynamic barrier to the formation of new particles and are shown to reduce the formation of seed particles by several orders of magnitude. This leads to the formation of aggregate particles which consist of a rather small number of primary particles and mainly grow by surface reaction. The primary contribution of condensation to growth of individual primary particles is shown to be very little. However, condensation should not be neglected as it has a strong impact on particle formation rates and hence on product characteristics such as the number of primary particles and primary particle size. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {This work is a parametric study of the fluxes of heat and salt across unsheared and sheared double-diffusive interfaces using one-dimensional-turbulence (ODT) simulations. It is motivated by the need to understand how these fluxes scale with parameters related to the fluid molecular properties and background shear. Comparisons are made throughout with previous models and available measurements. In unsheared interfaces, ODT simulations show that the dimensionless heat flux Nu scales with the stability parameter Rρ, Rayleigh number Ra and Prandtl number Pr as Nu ~ (Ra/Rρ)0.37±0.03 when Pr varies from 3 to 100 and as Nu ~ (Ra/Rρ)0.31Pr0.22±0.04 when Pr varies from 0.01 to 1. Here Ra/Rρ can be seen as the ratio of destabilizing and stabilizing effects. The simulation results also indicate that the ratio of salt and heat fluxes Rf is independent of Pr, scales with the Lewis number Le as Rf ~ Le0.41±0.04 when Rρ is large enough and deviates from this expression for low values of Rρ, when the interface becomes heavily eroded. In sheared interfaces, the simulations show three flow regimes. When the Richardson number Ri ≪ 1, shear-induced mixing dominates, the heat flux scales with the horizontal velocity difference across the interface and Rf = Rρ. Near Ri ~ 1 the heat and salt fluxes are seen to increase abruptly as the shear increases. The flow structure and scaling of the fluxes are similar to those of unsheared interfaces when Ri ≫ 1.},

A turbulent Dibutyl-Phthalate-laden Nitrogen jet diffusing in atmospheric air is used for validation. The proposed nucleation model treats the process in a probabilistic manner where the frequency of events is determined from local equilibrium conditions. Two methodologies for the sub-grid influence on nucleation rates are implemented: the presumed β-PDF and the source expansion method. Good agreement is found with respect to the experimental results for particle concentrations. The differences between using mean and instantaneous values for the evaluation of the nucleation rate are shown. For the grid spacing used, the unresolved scales seem to have little influence on the calculated particle concentrations. It is concluded that the use of instantaneous nucleation rates is advantageous and therefore it is important to consider a particle coupling that allows for the full use of instantaneous values. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

The models are applied to simulate the centreline of the hot-wall reactor and process conditions of Körmer et al. (2010, Journal of Aerosol Science 41, 998-1007). Both models are shown to give good agreement with experimental PSDs at a range of process conditions. However, it is reported that an unphysical sintering process is obtained when attempting to use Swihart & Girshick's kinetic mechanism, while solving for the sintering parameters. The model with adjusted gas-phase and surface growth processes gives better quantitative and qualitative agreement with experimental results. It is therefore recommended that further study into the kinetic and heterogeneous growth mechanisms be conducted in order to better understand the fundamental processes occurring in this hot-wall reactor. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

  abstract        = {This work proposes a kinetic model and an inception pathway for the flame synthesis of silica nanoparticles from tetraethoxysilane (TEOS). The kinetic model for the decomposition of TEOS is developed by generating reactions involving species that were reported in high concentrations at equilibrium. Flux and sensitivity analyses are then performed to identify the main reaction pathways. The parameters for these reactions are systematically fitted to experimental data using low discrepancy (LD) sequences and response surfaces. The main product of TEOS decomposition is deduced to be silicic acid (Si(OH) 4). To increase computational efficiency, the kinetic model has been reduced by determining the level of importance (LOI) of each species and retaining only the important ones. This reduced kinetic model is then coupled to a detailed population balance model using an operator splitting technique. New particle inception and surface growth steps have been incorporated into the particle model in which particles form and grow by the interaction of Si(OH) 4 monomers. Coagulation and sintering of particles are also included in the model and the material dependent sintering parameters have been determined by fitting the model to experimental values of collision and primary particle diameters using LD sequences. The particle size distributions and computer-generated TEM-style images have been generated and good agreement with experiments is observed. The gas-phase reactor composition and the temporal evolution of particle size at different temperatures are also presented. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

For fixed orientations, deviations of the internal field magnitude up to &#xB1;50% from that assumed by the Rayleigh&#x2013;Debye&#x2013;Gans Approximation (RDGA) are found. Given the refractive index of the aggregate monomers and conditions for the validity of the approximation, such large deviations are no surprise. Yet despite this deviation, the far-field scattered intensity from such aggregates agrees surprisingly well with that described by the RDGA. Moreover, if the average over an ensemble of many random aggregate-orientations is calculated, both the DDA and RDGA scattered intensities obey the well-known power-law functionality in terms of the scattering wave vector and show a forward-angle intensity-maximum proportional to the square of the number of monomers. The explanation for this lies in the over and under estimations made by the approximation of the internal field, which apparently mostly cancel upon integration to yield the scattered intensity. It is shown that this error cancellation is related to the fractal structure of the aggregate and that the agreement between the DDA and RDGA improves with aggregates of increasing size provided the fractal dimension is less than two. Overall, the analysis suggests that both the special fractal character of the aggregate and its orientational averaging is important to account for the experimentally observed validity of the RDGA despite its poor description of the internal fields.},

  abstract      = {Titanium dioxide (titania) is used in chemical sensors, pigments, and paints and holds promise as an antimicrobial agent. This is due to its photoinduced activity and, in nanostructured form, its high specific surface area. Particle size and surface area result from the interplay of fluid, chemical, and thermal dynamics as well as nucleation, condensation and coagulation. After nucleation, condensation, and coagulation are the dominant phenomena affecting the particle size distribution. Manufacture of nanostructured titania via gas-phase synthesis often occurs under turbulent flow conditions. This study examines the competition between coagulation and condensation in the growth of nanostructured titania. Direct numerical simulation is utilized in simulating the hydrolysis of titanium tetrachloride to produce titania in a turbulent, planar jet. The fluid, chemical, and particle fields are resolved as a function of space and time. As a result, knowledge of titania is available as a function of space, time, and phase (vapor or particle), facilitating the analysis of the particle dynamics by mechanism. Results show that in the proximal region of the jet nucleation and condensation are the dominant mechanisms. However once the jet potential core collapses and turbulent mixing begins, coagulation is the dominant mechanism. The data also shows that the coagulation growth-rate is as much as twice the condensation growth-rate. © 2015 Sean C. Garrick.},

  abstract = {Traditional modeling of radiative transfer in reacting flows has ignored turbulenceradiation
interactions (TRI). Radiative fluxes, flux divergences and radiative properties
have been based on mean temperature and concentration fields. However, both experimental
and theoretical work have suggested that mean radiative quantities may differ
significantly from those predictions based on the mean parameters because of their
strongly nonlinear dependence on the temperature and concentration fields. The composition
PDF method is able to consider many nonlinear interactions rigorously, and the
method is used here to study turbulence-radiation interactions. This paper tries to answer
two basic questions: (1) whether turbulence-radiation interactions are important in turbulent
flames or not; and (2) if they are important, then what correlations need to be
considered in the simulation to capture them. After conducting many flame simulations, it
was observed that, on average, TRI effects account for about 1/3 of the total drop in flame
peak temperature caused by radiative heat losses. In addition, this study shows that
consideration of the temperature self correlation alone is not sufficient to capture TRI, but
that the complete absorption coefficient-Planck function correlation must be considered.},

In the present paper an efficient emission scheme is developed for \{MCRT\} in highly inhomogeneous media represented by particle fields. Ray energies are limited to a narrow range to reduce statistical error, by having particles emit numbers of photons proportional to their emissive power (including combination of weak particles). A method to evaluate the radiative heat source, required by the overall energy equation, is also developed.

The linear eddy model is used to simulate turbulent advection. A laminar flamelet state relationship combustion model is employed along with two different soot models. The first soot model involves an extension of the laminar flamelet concept to soot using a soot volume fraction state relationship. The second soot model involves transport equations for soot mass fraction and soot number density, which include finite rate source terms to account for soot nucleation, surface growth, agglomeration, and oxidation. Radiation effects are accounted for by including the appropriate source/sink terms in the conservation of energy equation. The effects of a presumed surrounding large scale field which radiates with the spectral properties of soot at an assumed effective temperature are also included. Simulations are conducted for two values of the surrounding temperature and the model large eddy turnover time. The results capture several unique aspects of strongly radiating turbulent flames. In particular, an inflection point in the temperature versus mixture fraction profile is observed near the soot region which highlights the effects of radiative cooling. The large difference between radiation source terms calculated using mean properties and those calculated using instantaneous properties
highlights the important interactions between turbulence and radiation.},

The effect of initial conditions on the transition from coalescent to aggregate growth was investigated by simulating a series of freely propagating laminar premixed flames. The instant of transition and the degree of aggregation were analyzed in relation to variations in fuel type, fuel/air equivalence ratio, and pressure.

The distribution of particle mass concentration at different time is independent of the initial particle size. More particles are concentrated at outer edge of the bend.

  abstract = {Transported probability density function (TPDF) methods are well suited to modelling turbulent, reacting, variable density flows. One of the main challenges to the successful deployment of TPDF methods is accurately modelling the unclosed molecular mixing term. This study examines three of the most widely used mixing models: the Interaction by Exchange with the Mean (IEM), Modified Curl (MC) and Euclidean Minimum Spanning Tree (EMST) models. Direct numerical simulation (DNS) data-sets were used to provide both initial conditions and inputs needed over the course of the runs, including the mean flow velocities, mixing frequency, and the turbulent diffusion coefficient. The same chemical mechanism and thermodynamic properties were used, allowing the study to focus on the mixing model. The simulation scenario was a one-dimensional, nonpremixed, turbulent jet flame burning either a syngas or ethylene fuel stream that featured extinction and reignition. This test scenario was selected because extinction and reignition phenomena are sensitive to the mixing model. Three DNS cases were considered for both the syngas and ethylene cases with a parametric variation of Reynolds and Damköhler numbers, respectively. Extinction events became more prevalent with increasing Reynolds number in the syngas cases and with decreasing Damköhler number in the ethylene cases. The model was first tested with the mixing frequency defined from the dissipation rate and variance of mixture fraction. With this definition, for the syngas cases this study finds that the TPDF method is successful at predicting flame extinction and reignition using all three mixing models for the relatively lower and intermediate Reynolds number cases, but that all models under-predict reignition in the relatively higher Reynolds number case. In the ethylene fuelled cases, only the EMST mixing model correctly predicts the reignition event for the two higher Damköhler number cases, however, in the lowest Damköhler number case the EMST model over-predicts reignition and the IEM and MC models under-predict it. Mixing frequency was then modelled based on the turbulence frequency and a model constant Cϕ, the ratio of scalar to mechanical mixing rates. The DNS cases were reexamined with this definition and the results suggested that the optimal value for Cϕ is mixing model and case dependent. In particular, it was found in the ethylene case considered that reignition could be achieved with the IEM and MC models by adjusting the value of Cϕ.},

Two cases were calculated, case H, with a high-density ratio of flame pu/pb=7.53, and case L, low-density ratio of flame pu/pb=2.50, while u′/uL was nearly equal to unity. We obtained databases of fully developed stationary turbulent flames. These databases were investigated by analyzing the transport equation for turbulent kinetic energy to study flame-generated turbulence and its models. We found that turbulent fluctuations of all components, especially the streamwise component, were amplified in the flame brush and that flame-generated turbulence increased for a larger density ratio of the flame. Analysis based on the Favre-averaged transport equation for turbulent kinetic energy showed that pressure-related terms produced kinetic energy in the flame brush, the mean pressure gradient term was most important in case H and the pressure work term was most important in case L. On the other hand, the diffusion and dissipation term and velocity gradient term decreased kinetic energy. Next, modeling of the important terms in the balance equations were discussed. The mean pressure gradient term, pressure dilatation term, and additional dissipation components were modeled and compared with the direct numerical simulation (DNS) results. The mean pressure gradient term was modeled with assumption on the density, and the model was in good agreement with DNS. The other two terms were also modeled by scaling and these models mimicked DNS well.},

This study investigates the effects of different inception, growth coagulation, and oxidation source terms in a two-equation semi-empirical soot model that has been implemented to model two turbulent ethylene/air jet flames. The gas-phase chemistry is modeled using the laminar flamelet approach. A new soot inception submodel is proposed that is based on the naphthalene formation rate calculated by the detailed chemical kinetics. The expected value of the formation rate is stored in the flamelet library. Model predictions were compared with the measurements of Young and Moss. The predictions of the soot volume fraction are very sensitive to the soot surface growth rate. The soot predictions agree well with measurements when the surface growth rate is assumed to be proportional to the square root of the surface area. The result also indicate that the naphthalene inception route exhibits better performance. Finally a new soot model with an optimal combination of rates was developed. The model predictions provided good agreement with the experimental temperature, mixture fraction, and soot volume fraction distributions along both the axial and radial directions. The optimal soot model was also successfully validated on another turbulent ethylene/air jet flame.},

  abstract      = {Ultrafine iron powder was synthesized in an atmospheric-pressure radio-frequency plasma reactor by injecting relatively course iron powder into the plasma, where it evaporated. The renucleated iron particles were characterized by means of a sampling capillary and dilution system interfaced to an electrical aerosol analyzer, a condensation nucleus counter and an electrostatic aerosol sampler. Volume-mean particle diameters for samples obtained near the downstream end of the reactor ranged from about 20 to 70 nm, with particle size increasing as the feed rate of injected iron powder was increased. A two-dimensional numerical model was developed, which solved the plasma conservation equations to predict temperature and velocity distributions, heating and evaporation of the injected iron powder, nucleation and growth of iron particles, and particle transport by convection, diffusion and thermophoresis. Mean particle diameters predicted by the model were in good agreement with the experimental data, although the data indicated broader size distributions and flatter radial profiles of particle concentration than predicted by the model. © 1993.},

The pipelined LU-SGS scheme optimized for the parallel-implicit time-integration is also employed.

  abstract = {Vapor-phase arsenic in coal combustion flue gas causes deactivation of the catalysts used in selective catalytic reduction (SCR) systems for NOx control. A one-dimensional model has been developed to predict the behavior of arsenic in the postcombustion region of a coal-fired boiler as a function of gas residence time. The purpose of the model is to calculate the partitioning of arsenic between the vapor phase from volatilization and arsenic on the ash particles due to surface reaction and/or condensation at temperatures characteristic of SCR systems. The model accounts for heterogeneous condensation of arsenic on the fly ash, as well as surface reaction for two regimes: (1) the free molecular regime (submicrometer ash particles) and (2) the continuum regime (supermicrometer ash particles). All gas properties are computed as functions of gas temperature, pressure, and composition, which are allowed to vary. The arsenic model can be used to calculate the impact of coal composition on vapor-phase arsenic at SCR inlet temperatures, which will help utilities better manage coal quality and increase catalyst lifetimes on units operating with SCR. The arsenic model has been developed and implemented and was tested against experimental data for several coals.},

  abstract      = {Venusian Y-shaped clouds have been observed by ultraviolet (UV) detectors. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the Y-shaped cloud pattern is maintained by the dynamical combination of an equatorial 4-day wave and a Rossby wave. In the model of the Y-shaped cloud, however, material transport was not considered. Present numerical simulations, including not only dynamical transport, but also the essential microphysics of aerosols, are conducted together with the chemical reactions of the aerosol precursor gas, SO2. Results indicate that aerosols are accumulated in the polar regions due to poleward transport. As a result, the scattering coefficient becomes higher with increasing latitude. At the low-latitude cloud-top heights, the dark (bright) region is formed by the small (large) aerosol concentration associated with planetary-scale waves since the zonal-mean aerosol concentration is relatively small. On the other hand, the longitudinal contrast of the scattering coefficient becomes very small at the high-latitude cloud top since the zonal-mean aerosol concentration is much larger than the perturbed one. In the cloud-top regions where aerosol scattering is weak, solar radiation may penetrate the area without suffering much extinction. The UV radiation is strongly absorbed in the middle cloud layer (∼55 km), while visible radiation is scattered within this layer. As a result, weakly scattering regions appear dark in UV images. On the other hand, visible radiation is scattered in the middle cloud layer, so that visible image contrast hardly occurs. The incorporation of planetary-scale waves leads to the Y-shaped cloud pattern at low latitudes. Bright polar bands are also formed in the high-latitude regions, where the total surface area of aerosols reaches a maximum.},

  abstract      = {We consider condensing flow with droplets that nucleate and grow, but do not slip with respect to the surrounding gas phase. To compute the local droplet size distribution, one could solve the general dynamic equation and the fluid dynamics equations simultaneously. To reduce the overall computational effort of this procedure by roughly an order of magnitude, we propose an alternative procedure, in which the general dynamic equation is initially replaced by moment equations complemented with a closure assumption. The key notion is that the flow field obtained from this so-called method of moments, i.e., solving the moment equations and the fluid dynamics equations simultaneously, approximately accommodates the thermodynamic effects of condensation. Instead of estimating the droplet size distribution from the obtained moments by making assumptions about its shape, we subsequently solve the exact general dynamic equation along a number of selected fluid trajectories, keeping the flow field fixed. This alternative procedure leads to fairly accurate size distribution estimates at low cost, and it eliminates the need for assumptions on the distribution shape. Furthermore, it leads to the exact size distribution whenever the closure of the moment equations is exact. © 2005 American Institute of Physics.},

The module 6M is based upon the quadrature method of moments (QMOM) [McGraw, 1997] and the multiple isomomental distribution aerosol surrogate (MIDAS) method [Wright, 2000]. The module 6M evolves the lowest six radial moments of H<inf>2</inf>SO<inf>4</inf>-H<inf>2</inf>O aerosols for a comprehensive set of dynamical processes including the formation of new particles via binary H<inf>2</inf>SO<inf>4</inf>-H<inf>2</inf>O nucleation, condensational growth, coagulation, evolution due to cloud processing, size-resolved dry deposition, and water uptake and release with changing relative humidity. Performance of the moment-based aerosol evolution is examined and evaluated by comparison with results obtained using a high-resolution discrete model of the particle dynamics for a range of conditions representative of the boundary layer and lower troposphere. Overall, the performance of 6M is good relative to uncertainties associated with other processes represented in CTMs for the 30 test cases evaluated. Differences between 6M and the discrete model in the mass/volume moment and in the partitioning of sulfur (VI) between the gas and aerosol phases remain under 1% whenever significant aerosol is present, and differences in particle number rarely exceed 15%. Estimates of cloud droplet number from 6M are on average within 16% of those of the discrete model, with a significant part of these differences attributable to limitations of the discrete dynamics. Multimodal lognormal (MIDAS) surrogates to the underlying size distributions derived from the 6M moments are in good agreement with the benchmark size distributions.

  abstract = {We extendthe application of moment methods to multivariate suspended particle population problems—those for which size alone is insufficient to specify the state of a particle in the population. Specifically, a bivariate extension of the quadrature method of moments (QMOM) (R. McGraw, Aerosol Sci. Technol. 27, 255 (1997)) is presented for efficiently modeling the dynamics of a population of inorganic nanoparticles undergoing simultaneous coagulation and particle sintering. Continuum regime calculations are presented for the Koch–Friedlander–Tandon–Rosner model, which includes coagulation by Brownian diffusion (evaluated for particle fractal dimensions, Df, in the range 1.8–3) and simultaneous sintering of the resulting aggregates (P. Tandon and D. E. Rosner, J. Colloid Interface Sci.213, 273 (1999)). For evaluation purposes, and to demonstrate the computational efficiency of the bivariate QMOM, benchmark calculations are carried out using a high-resolution discrete method to evolve the particle distribution function n(ν, a) for short to intermediate times (where ν and a are particle volume and surface area, respectively). Time evolution of a selected set of 36 low-order mixed moments is obtained by integration of the full bivariate distribution and compared with the corresponding moments obtained directly using two different extensions of the QMOM. With the more extensive treatment, errors of less than 1% are obtained over substantial aerosol evolution, while requiring only a few minutes (rather than days) of CPU time. Longer time QMOM simulations lend support to the earlier finding of a self-preserving limit for the dimensionless joint (ν, a) particle distribution function under simultaneous coagulation and sintering (Tandon and Rosner, 1999; D. E. Rosner and S. Yu, AIChE J., 47 (2001)). We demonstrate that, even in the bivariate case, it is possible to use the QMOM to rapidly model the approach to asymptotic behavior, allowing an immediate assessment of when previously established asymptotic results can be applied to dynamical situations of current/future interest.},

  abstract      = {We focus on modeling and control of an aerosol flow reactor used to produce titania powder. We initially present a detailed population balance model for the process which accounts for simultaneous nucleation, Brownian and shear-induced coagulation, and convective transport and describe the spatio-temporal evolution of the aerosol volume distribution. Then, under the assumption of lognormal aerosol volume distribution, the method of moments is employed for the derivation of a model that describes the evolution of the three leading moments of the volume distribution. The moment model, together with the fundamental model that describes the temperature in the reactor and concentrations of the gas-phase species, are subsequently used to synthesize a nonlinear output feedback controller which manipulates the temperature of the reactor wall to achieve an aerosol size distribution in the outlet of the reactor with desired geometric average particle diameter. The nonlinear controller is successfully implemented on the process model and is shown to deal effectively with external disturbances.},

  abstract = {We introduce an efficient stochastic approach to solve the population balance equation that describes the formation and oxidation of soot particles in a laminar premixed flame. The approach is based on a stochastic particle system representing the ensemble of soot particles. The processes contributing to the formation and oxidation of soot particles are treated in a probabilistic manner. The stochastic algorithm, which makes use of an efficient majorant kernel and the method of fictitious jumps, resolves the entire soot particle distribution (PSDF) without introducing additional closure assumptions. A fuel-rich laminar premixed acetylene flame is computed using a detailed kinetic soot model. Solutions are obtained for both, the stochastic approach and the method of moments combined with a modified version of the Premix, CHEMKIN code. In this manner, the accuracy of the method of moments in a laminar premixed flame simulation is investigated. It is found that the accuracy for the first moment is excellent (5% error), and mean error for rest of the moments is within 25%. Also the effect of the oxidation of the smallest particles (burnout) has been quantified but was found not to be important in the flame investigated. The time evolution of computed size distributions and their integral properties are compared to experimental measurements and the agreement was found to be satisfactory. Finally, the efficiency of the stochastic method is studied.},

The databank contains the line parameters (positions, intensities, air- and self-broadened half-widths, coefficients of temperature dependence of air- and self-broadened half-widths, and air-broadened pressure shifts) of the four most abundant isotopologues of CO2. A reference temperature is 296 K and an intensity cutoff is 10−27 cm−1/molecule cm−2 at 4000 K. The databank has 628,324,454 entries, covers the 226–8310 cm−1 spectral range and designed for the temperature range 2500–5000 K. Format of CDSD-4000 is similar to that of HITRAN-2008. The databank has been generated within the framework of the method of effective operators and based on the global fittings of spectroscopic parameters (parameters of the effective Hamiltonians and effective dipole moment operators) to observed data collected from the literature. The databank is useful for studying high-temperature radiative properties of CO2, including exoplanets atmospheres, aerothemal modeling for Mars entry missions, high-temperature laboratory spectra, and industrial applications.

The construction of an LII instrument for fire measurements is presented in detail. Soot volume fraction imaging from 2 m diameter pool fires burning blended toluene/methanol liquid fuels is demonstrated along with a detailed report of measurement uncertainty in the challenging pool fire environment. Our LII instrument relies upon remotely located laser, optical, and detection systems and the insertion of water-cooled, fiber-bundle-coupled collection optics into the fire plume. Calibration of the instrument was performed using an ethylene/air laminar diffusion flame produced by a Santoro-type burner, which allowed for the extraction of absolute soot volume fractions from the LII images. Single-laser-shot two-dimensional images of the soot layer structure are presented with very high volumetric spatial resolution of the order of 10−5 cm3. Probability density functions of the soot volume fraction fluctuations are constructed from the large LII image ensembles. The results illustrate a highly intermittent soot fluctuation field with potentially large macroscale soot structures and clipped soot probability densities.},

In this model, the closure of the moment equations is achieved by using the Taylor expansion technique, and the fractional-order moments can be used to improve the accuracy of the results. The newly proposed method has no prior requirement for the shape of the particle size distribution. By comparing it with other known methods both in free molecular and continuum regimes, the new approach is found to be the most accurate method. The results show that the predictions of the lower-order moments are not significantly influenced by the higher-order ones, and the higher-order moments are not necessary if one intends to increase the accuracy of the numerical predictions. © 2014 The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences.},

The reliability of the analytical solution with three mass fractal dimensions of 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0 in the continuum-slip regime was verified. The accuracy of the new analytical solution is affected by both the Knudsen number and the mass fractal dimension. The new analytical solution can be further improved in accuracy by introducing a correction factor to the originally derived mathematical formula. The new analytical solution was finally confirmed to possess potential for replacing the numerical solution in the continuum-slip regime. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

  abstract        = {We review models and numerical methods used in flame synthesis of organic and inorganic nanoparticles. We discuss a general model in which particles form in the gas phase and grow through mass-adding surface reactions, condensation, and coagulation. They shrink or reshape by sintering and mass-abstracting surface reactions. The model is formulated in terms of a population balance which can incorporate a range of levels of detail, i.e. a varying number of internal coordinates. These coordinates can not only describe the geometry of a particle but also its chemical composition or age. In the simplest version a particle is modelled as a sphere whereas in the most complicated form a particle is modelled as an agglomerate of smaller or primary particles where the geometrical shape is known exactly. For these population balance models a number of different numerical approaches exist. We review the method of moments, sectional, finite element, and Monte Carlo methods and give examples of their applications in f lame synthesis. Different strategies for coupling a population balance to laminar and turbulent flows are reviewed. For turbulent f lows the closure problems arising from chemical reactions and the population balance are brief ly discussed. We then summarize the literature on nanoparticle modelling from laboratory to industrial scale and highlight important areas for future research. © 2005, Hosokawa Powder Technology Foundation.

And we also review the control of nanoparticle size distribution, some nonlinear control strategies were looked into. A general model in which nanoparticles form in gas phase and grow through chemical reaction, nucleation, condensation and coagulation is discussed. Particles dispersed in a fluid move randomly, due to Brownian motion, and, along their trajectories, they collide with each other. The model is formulated in terms of a detailed population balance which describes how aerosol size distribution evolves with time. For this population balance model, a number of different numerical approaches exist. We reviewed sectional, finite element and Monte Carlo methods, method of moments.

  abstract        = {We study the evolution of the particle number concentration, mass concentration, particle polydispersity, particle diameter and geometric standard deviation considering particle coagulation and dispersion in a rotating curved pipe at different Reynolds number, Schmidt number and F number. It is found that, when the Coriolis force and the centrifugal force point to the same direction, particles concentrate near the outside edge of the pipe, which becomes more obvious as time goes by. The particle number and mass concentration increase faster at the early stage than that at the later stage, and approach a stable value finally. As the coagulation proceeds, the particle diameter, polydispersity and geometric standard deviation increase and have high values in the region close to the outside edge of the pipe. When the Coriolis force and the centrifugal force point to the opposite direction and the Coriolis force is more dominant than the centrifugal force, particles concentrate near the inside edge of the pipe. The particles in the region with a high number concentration have high mass concentration, large diameter and high polydispersity as well as large geometric standard deviation. The particle distribution is dependent on the balance of the pipe curvature and rotating speed. The Reynolds number and the Schmidt number have effects on the particle distribution when other parameters remain unchanged. An increase in the Reynolds number leads to an increase in particle number concentration and mass concentration, and a decrease in particle polydispersity, particle diameter and geometric standard deviation. With the increase of Schmidt number the particle number concentration and mass concentration increase, and the particle polydispersity, particle diameter and geometric standard deviation decrease. © Science China Press and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2011.},

The simulation initiates from the benzene molecules observed in the thermosphere and follows their evolution to larger aromatic structures through reaction with gas-phase radical species. Aromatics are allowed to collide and provide the first primary particles, which further grow to aggregates through coagulation. We also consider for the first time the contribution of heterogenous processes at the surface of the particles, which are described by the deposition of the formed aromatic structures on the surface of the particles, and also through the chemical reaction with radical species. Our results demonstrate that the evolution of aerosols in terms of size, shape, and density is a result of competing processes between surface growth, coagulation, and sedimentation. Furthermore, our simulations clearly demonstrate the presence of a spherical growth region in the upper atmosphere followed by a transition to an aggregate growth region below. The transition altitude ranges between 500 and 600 km based on the parameters of the simulation. © 2011. The American Astronomical Society.},

  abstract  = {We utilize the Volume Integral Equation Formulation (VIEF) and the method of moments to calculate the electromagnetic scattering and absorption of aerosol particles with branched-chain structures. Two kinds of polarization of the incident electromagnetic wave were considered: the cross- and end-fire polarizations. The numerical results of internal electric field distribution, absorbed power, and extinction and scattering cross sections, obtained from the VIEF, show excellent agreement with the Mie theory for the special case of spherical particles. Comparison between the results of the VIEF and Iterative Extended Boundary Condition Method for very long oriented (elongated) chains of particles also showed good agreement. After validating the accuracy of the VIEF, the absorption characteristics of three branched-chain structures simulated from microscopic pictures of coagulated smoke aerosol particles were calculated. Results showed that the ratio of absorption in the two polarization cases, Pcross-fire/Pend-fire, for very long oriented chain structures is as high as a factor of 4 at lower frequencies ($\lambda$ $=$ 10 $\mu$m). While in the higher frequency ($\lambda$ $=$ 0.5-$\mu$m) case, the ratio of Pcross-fire/Pend-fire is reduced to 2.0. For branched-chain structures, the ratio of Pcross-fire/Pend-fire decreased with the increase in the number of the side branches. These observations show that the frequency, polarization, and structure factors play important roles in determining the optical characteristics of branched chains of aerosol particles.},

Moreo ver, the scope of application of the TEMOM model with a fourth-order Taylor expansion is limited.

The evolution of the homogeneous nucleation rate, work of nucleus formation, and critical nucleus size along different expansion paths is investigated here for the model system phenanthrene‐carbon dioxide. Nucleation rates are the result of the competition among solvent expansion, cooling due to depressurization, and high supersaturation. Although supersaturations can reach very high values (&gt; 106), relatively flat nucleation rate profiles result due to cooling and expansion. For an interfacial tension of 0.02 N/m, computed nucleation rates never exceed 104 s−1 · cm−3. A substantial fraction of the maximum nucleation rate is attained with partial decompression to pressures above 1 bar. Copyright © 1990 American Institute of Chemical Engineers},

  abstract        = {When transporting nanoparticles with diameters ranging from 8 to 550 nm through pipe bends, the penetration efficiency is related to the flow property, bend curvature and particle property. In the present study, the moment equations for nanoparticles are derived and solved with the Taylor-series expansion moment method by considering the combined effect of particle diffusion, coagulation and breakage. The results show that the particle number concentration increases linearly with time at the initial stage, then grows slowly, and finally attains a stable state after dimensionless time t is larger than 10. The increase of Dean number leads to an increase of averaged particle number concentration from 0 to 0.135-1.372 depending on the values of Dean number and Schmidt number. The average particle diameter increases with time, and decreases with increasing Dean and Schmidt numbers. The average particle polydispersity increases slowly at the initial stage, and then grows fastly. As the decreases of Schmidt and Dean numbers, the average particle polydispersity increases. More particles, especially large particles, gather near the outer bend wall. Then the penetration efficiencies are calculated and the corresponding experiments are carried out. The results show that the penetration efficiencies increase with increasing Dean number under laminar flow condition. The effect of Dean number on the penetration efficiency is dependent on Schmidt number. There exists a critical value of Dean number beyond which the penetration efficiency turns from increment to decrement, and this critical value is dependent on Schmidt number. The penetration efficiencies increase with increasing Schmidt number. The penetration efficiencies are higher in the case of higher Dean number than that of lower one, and the difference in the higher and lower Dean number becomes small when Schmidt number is larger than 20,000. Finally, the expressions of penetration efficiency as a function of related parameters for the particles with diameters ranging from 8 to 550 nm are derived based on the numerical and experimental data. The expressions not only cover the present and previous experimental data, but can also be used to the case with wider range of Dean and Schmidt numbers. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

  abstract = {While diesel engines are arguably superior to any other power-production device for the transportation sector in terms of efficiency, torque, and overall driveability, they suffer from inferior performance in terms of noise, NOx and particulate emissions. The majority of particulate originates with soot particles which are formed in fuel-rich regions of burning diesel jets. Over the past two decades, our understanding of the formation process of soot in diesel combustion has transformed from inferences based on exhaust measurements and laboratory flames to direct in-cylinder observations that have led to a transformation in diesel engine combustion. In-cylinder measurements show the diesel spray to produce a jet which forms a lifted, partially premixed, turbulent diffusion flame. Soot formation has been found to be strongly dependent on air entrainment in the lifted portion of the jet as well as by oxygen in the fuel and to a lesser extent the composition and structure of hydrocarbons in the fuel. Soot surviving the combustion process and exiting in the exhaust is dominated by soot from fuel-rich pockets which do not have time to mix and burn prior to exhaust valve opening. Higher temperatures at the end of combustion enhance the burnout of soot, while high temperatures at the time of injection reduce air entrainment and increase soot formation. Using a conceptual model based on in-cylinder soot and combustion measurements, trends seen in exhaust particulate can be explained. The current trend in diesel engine emissions control involves multi-injection combustion strategies which are transforming the picture of diesel combustion rapidly into a series of low temperature, stratified charge, premixed combustion events where NOx formation is avoided because of low temperature and soot formation is avoided by leaning the mixture or increasing air entrainment prior to ignition.},

  abstract      = {With the recent interest in the chemical, electronic and optical properties of nanometer scale metal particles, there is now interest in manufacturing these materials in larger quantities. Since both small particle size and high particle number concentrations are sought, there is a need for improved particle generation reactors that can realize both goals. Here, results are presented for the synthesis of indium metal nanoparticles in an evaporation/condensation aerosol generator. Size distributions were measured for metal nanoparticles formed using a standard flow configuration, as well as using several variations on the standard configuration. The aim of the modifications is to increase the cooling rate and thus, to increase the nucleation rate of the nanoparticles. An increase in the number concentration of particles and, in some cases, a significant decrease in average particle size was observed when the modified reactor configurations were used. These results can be explained by the changes in the time-temperature history of the nanoparticles resulting from the modifications to the aerosol generator. A monodisperse model of nanoparticle formation and growth, accounting for nucleation, condensation and coagulation, was used to describe particle formation in the standard flow configuration, to guide the modifications, and to describe particle formation in one of the modified configurations, with qualitative agreement seen between measured and predicted particle sizes. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.
