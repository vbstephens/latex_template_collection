\section{Background}
\label{sec:section_label_1}

Words go here. Here's an equation:
\begin{equation}
    f_l^{(x,y)} \equiv = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \sum_{j=1}^{\infty} (m_i + m_j)^l m_i^x m_j^y (m_i^{1/3} + m_j^{1/3})^2 m_i^{-1/2}
    m_j^{-1/2} N_i N_j.
\end{equation}

Reference things like this \cite{Leung_1991}. Make code blocks in figures like in Figure \ref{odt_input}.

Figure template is here, too. Words here. Here is an example of a bulleted list of breakfast foods:
\begin{itemize}
    \item waffles
    \item pancakes
    \item eggs
\end{itemize}
